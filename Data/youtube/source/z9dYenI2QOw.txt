1
00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:02,460
(loud applause and cheering)

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,180
- [Joel] Hey everybody, come on let's welcome

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,180
Mr Kanye West today. (loud applause and cheering)

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,070
awesome to have you, all right guys y'all can be seated.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,403
So awesome to have you at Lakewood and just feel blessed.

6
00:00:18,777 --> 00:00:22,527
(loud applause and cheering)

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,160
All right guys y'all can be seated.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,630
Kanye was

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,030
so kind to come for tonight's

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,400
Sunday service and when I heard he was coming I said,

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,270
man you gotta come on Sunday morning, at least say hello

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,470
to the people so.

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,020
Here we feel blessed to have you Kanye and Kanye

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,150
just some thoughts maybe.

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,270
We've all seen, you know, something happen in the last year

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,420
or so, you're not where you were back then.

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,620
Maybe you can just speak a little bit to the transition

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,353
and you know, how are you here today at Lakewood?

19
00:00:56,018 --> 00:01:00,294
(loud applause and cheering)

20
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:03,757
(audience member cheers)

21
00:01:03,757 --> 00:01:07,507
(loud applause and cheering)

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,340
- Well I know that God's been calling me for a long time

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,004
and the devil's been distracting me for a long time.

24
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:25,754
(loud applause and cheering)

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,080
And when I was

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,040
you know, at my lowest point

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,080
you know God was there with me and sending me visions

28
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,840
and inspiring me.

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,290
And I remember sitting in the hospital at UCLA

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,740
after having a mental breakdown and

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,500
there's documentations of me drawing a church

32
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,790
and saying, writing, start a church in the middle of

33
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,427
Calabasas and even after that I went and made the

34
00:02:00,427 --> 00:02:01,880
The Life of Pablo album.

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,420
I said this is a gospel album and I didn't know how to

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,890
totally make a gospel album and the Christians that were

37
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,223
around where too,

38
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,870
I would say beaten into submission by society and not

39
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,423
speak up and profess the gospel to, you know.

40
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,533
To me because I was a superstar,

41
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,569
but the only superstar is Jesus.

42
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,319
(loud applause and cheering)

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,650
So as I sat there saying, you know I'm gonna make

44
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,850
a gospel album, there where Christians that were there

45
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,970
that were not.

46
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,040
Excuse me brother,

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,780
I go into these strings of consciousness when I'm talking

48
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,780
and when you're speaking in the middle of it,

49
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,613
it distracts me.

50
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:49,020
I really appreciate support but I would like for everybody

51
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,190
to be completely silent so I can let God flow through me

52
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,148
as I speak to you guys today.

53
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:57,898
(loud applause and cheering)

54
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,920
So in the studio,

55
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,680
and this studio, it's good to compare to places

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,140
that you're in in life, where people tell you to

57
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,670
quiet your voice and not talk about

58
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,670
Jesus, you know, so loud.

59
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,500
But everything else is so loud around us.

60
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
When I'm in California, when I'm in Vegas they got posters

61
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,290
up advertising, you know, sex trafficking because if

62
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,100
there's a advertisement for a strip club

63
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,560
that is advertising sex trafficking because at the end

64
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,670
of the night when they close up, the manager says

65
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,543
how much traffic do we have?

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,350
So,

67
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,450
if it's a man that's going through things with his family

68
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,080
or going through things at work and he feels

69
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,423
he has to go there.

70
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,610
We all end up participating, whether it's the spirits

71
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,560
that get advertised to us all the time.

72
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,203
Alcohol is, they call it a spirit.

73
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,490
So we get constant advertisement for spirits.

74
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,950
We get constant advertisement for strip clubs and other

75
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,700
things like that but then we bring up the name of Jesus

76
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,970
we're told to be quiet.

77
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,023
Quiet that down.

78
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,880
So, even for someone who's professing God and saying,

79
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,080
this going to be a gospel album, the devil's gonna come

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,720
and do everything he can to distract people

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,720
from knowing how to fully be in service to the Lord.

82
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,000
And,

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,690
all of that arrogance and confidence and cockiness that

84
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,373
y'all seen me use,

85
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,133
before God, it's now using for him.

86
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:40,731
(loud applause and cheering)

87
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,530
Because every time I stand up,

88
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,280
I feel,

89
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,383
that I'm standing up and drawing a line in the sand.

90
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,420
And saying, I'm here in service to God

91
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,053
and no weapon formed against me

92
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:02,130
(loud applause and cheering)

93
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,283
shall prosper.

94
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:07,140
- [Joel] That's so good Kanye.

95
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,840
You know Kanye maybe one of the most powerful, I've heard

96
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,930
a lot of your interviews but maybe,

97
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,600
can you speak any to, you said you use to worship the god

98
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,338
of fame and the god of some of things and that didn't

99
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:21,590
fulfill you, can you talk a little bit about that?

100
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,320
- Yes because it's presented to us on TV.

101
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,420
There's a rumor I heard where

102
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,540
someone had sat down with Sammy Davis Junior and this is no,

103
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,090
you know, knock to his family but I wanna use a specific

104
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,600
name that we know of because it's a celebrity name,

105
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,820
we have these icons, we use it.

106
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,180
And he leaned in and he said, you know,

107
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,480
Satan is as powerful as God.

108
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,350
And that is the mentality

109
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,050
that people have a lot of times when they're in service

110
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,240
to fame, money, manpower.

111
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,080
You start to feel like Satan is the most powerful

112
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,940
and you start to feel like if you're in service to God

113
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,260
that in life it means you will not prosper.

114
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,100
And the only way to prosper is in service to fame

115
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,570
and it, you know.

116
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,653
It's like devil stole all the good producers.

117
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,690
The devil stole all the good musicians.

118
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,563
All the good artists, all the good designers.

119
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,810
All the good business people.

120
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,000
And said you gotta come over and work for me and now

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
the trend

122
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,600
the shift is going to change, Jesus has won the victory.

123
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:45,434
(loud applause and cheering)

124
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:51,952
Because now, and I told you about

125
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,150
my arrogance and cockiness already.

126
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,983
Now,

127
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,330
the greatest artist that god has ever created

128
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,761
is now working for him.

129
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:07,511
(loud applause and cheering)

130
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,330
- I thought Kanye, you know, I grew up,

131
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,540
I'm a preacher's kid.

132
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,030
You didn't grow up like me, how, you know,

133
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,350
maybe speak to, a little bit, to your upbringing

134
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,833
and you know, how that all, how all the effected you?

135
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,690
- Well my dad had me in church

136
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,740
three times a week.

137
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,840
For me as a kid,

138
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,310
you know going to church on Wednesday instead of going

139
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,720
to basketball practice or getting to play video games

140
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,180
got to be, you know, a little bit boring.

141
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,170
And my mom had me in church twice a week,

142
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,680
or definitely on Sundays.

143
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,830
We actually grew with the church, it was a pastor named

144
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,090
Johnny Coleman and we grew from a small church to

145
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,930
a mega-church, a Chicago version.

146
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,113
I think it grew to like five, 6 000.

147
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,250
And my mom always had the records in the house and we would

148
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,623
be playing a lot of R&B records but then we'd go and hear

149
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,650
the gospel and hear worship.

150
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,820
So you know, as I now have a family, I'm 42 years old

151
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,449
and married for five years.

152
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:31,199
(loud applause and cheering)

153
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,160
There's a blatant responsibility for me to become more like

154
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,130
my mother who's gone to heaven and more like my father

155
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,850
who has a, who's working on building a water purification

156
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,238
center in the DR.

157
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:51,080
(loud applause and cheering)

158
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,680
You know with rappers there's so many things that we've done

159
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,150
where,

160
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,170
to maintain the idea of coolness.

161
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,130
You know we have our own daughters and we still be

162
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,880
rapping about trying to hook up with somebody daughter.

163
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,750
Like not taking the responsibility as a man,

164
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,090
that's why I say the song Closed On Sunday, is the hardest

165
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,220
record ever made.

166
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,140
It's hard as a NWA record because it's talking about

167
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,130
protecting your kids from the indoctrination of the media.

168
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,570
The thousands and thousands of images

169
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,320
that are fed to children by the age of six or seven.

170
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,780
And within those images,

171
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,010
there are images mixed in that we don't know about

172
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,100
as parents, that are purposely mixed in to lower

173
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,840
the kids' superpower and esteem so that they can be

174
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,760
more susceptible to consumption and feel that they need to

175
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,190
consume and became a part of the robotic,

176
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,490
numeric system

177
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,233
that controls so much of the media.

178
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,893
Did I?

179
00:10:03,893 --> 00:10:05,860
You know I just had to say it like it is, you can rewind

180
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,302
it and then do research what I'm talking about but.

181
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:11,360
(chuckles)

182
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,520
- Kanye one my favorite songs on your new album

183
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,470
is that song God is.

184
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,050
In that middle you've got that part where

185
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,370
I mean, you're preaching in the middle.

186
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,960
It's very very powerful and you know, maybe not everybody's

187
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,940
heard it but I just ask if I could play maybe this

188
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,450
30, 40, 60 second clip and listen to this,

189

(loud applause and cheering)

209
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,020
You said more in 60 seconds than I say in my

210
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,520
30 minute message right there.

211
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:24,000
You know what, that's really powerful man.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,010
The addictions have to go, the demons have to go.

213
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,740
You wanna speak to it all, speak to it at all?

214
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,510
- Yeah those addictions are

215
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:35,790
are on us, even when you are saved and fully delivered.

216
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,580
You know when I started Sunday Service I started my church

217
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,610
which people told me I could call a church because you aint

218
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,833
got no pastor, so it aint really a church.

219
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,780
But it was church fOR us, it's all we had.

220
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,420
And you know,

221
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,170
(loud applause and cheering)

222
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,303
we didn't really have a place to consistently go,

223
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,930
you know, every week and bring the family and we started off

224
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,100
by just, you know, having records that were good

225
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,309
and I'm gonna get to the addiction part.

226
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,410
(laughter)

227
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,200
you know nice,

228
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,770
easy to listen to records and good feelings.

229
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,740
I had a friend that came by and said,

230
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,260
but you have to say the name Jesus, you can have

231
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,110
you know, all of this good sounding stuff but eventually

232
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,290
people are gonna need solid food.

233
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,320
So we, we started to (loud applause and cheering)

234
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,550
then incorporate that.

235
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,430
And those addictions, these different addictions

236
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,000
that all of us have

237
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,960
are things that can bring, I like to say bring our

238
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,513
Christian score-card down.

239
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,610
And they'll hit you sometimes, you'll just go ahead and

240
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,450
just pour that drink

241
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,010
and then

242
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:49,843
repent for it.

243
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:53,470
So we're all human, we all gonna fall short

244
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,840
of the glory.

245
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,770
I aint seen nobody with a 23 play as good as Michael Jordan.

246
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,180
So,

247
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,830
Christians are not going to be Christ.

248
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,750
We are going to follow Christ and be Christ-like

249
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,950
and repent for our sins.

250
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,160
But there's a lot of times when people don't wanna come

251
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,470
to Christ, they try to point out

252
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,170
the worst Christian they ever met.

253
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,070
But when you play basketball you don't point to the worst

254
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,043
basketball player, you point to the best basketball player.

255
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,574
So with these addictions that hit us,

256
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:37,530
it's that constant

257
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,250
you know, being in constant repentance.

258
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,960
A lot of people who don't wanna accept what the Bible says

259
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,490
is because they don't wanna accept that

260
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,660
they are in the wrong or that they are basking and living

261
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,040
and capitalizing off of sin.

262
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,200
We all have sin,

263
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,730
it's another thing to just be selling drugs

264
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,357
in the children's parking-lot.

265
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,477
(loud applause and cheering)

266
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:10,670
(laughter)

267
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,465
- Finally, couple of things I was thinking there, let's see

268
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:16,690
(laughter)

269
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,510
- You know one of it is this, we got two more things

270
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,343
I wanna get to.

271
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,050
I heard, well let me go to the second one first.

272
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,642
What would you say to the younger Kanye?

273
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:28,750
You know there's some young people listening, maybe they're

274
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,510
where you were 10 years ago or something.

275
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,010
You know, any advice for them?

276
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,453
- You know.

277
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,983
It's not that

278
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,263
that the younger Kanye.

279
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,120
There's nothing I could say to the younger Kanye

280
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,940
through words, I could speak to the younger Kanye

281
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,493
through music. (loud applause and cheering)

282
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,830
So we on they neck!

283
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,303
This music gonna come every month.

284
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,150
We dropping that heat, we in the studio.

285
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,290
God is strengthening our hands, we have writers,

286
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,230
we have producers, we taking all the most fire producers

287
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,546
and bringing them back to God.

288
00:15:19,546 --> 00:15:23,296
(loud applause and cheering)

289
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,180
All the best voices, all the best dancers.

290
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,350
All the worship,

291
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,770
for us to see that it's through Christ.

292
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,460
I mean following the Bible can free us all and it was,

293
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,880
you know, interesting you'd think.

294
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,990
You know when we were at the prisons to you know,

295
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,453
professing how Jesus can set you free.

296
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,313
And it's a.

297
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,290
It's true, the more and more this entire country

298
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,570
follows Christ and sets the example that we are

299
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,655
a Christian country.

300
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:05,405
(loud applause and cheering)

301
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,260
They're attempting to take prayer out of schools.

302
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,690
When you remove the fear and love of God, you create the

303
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,965
fear and love of everything else.

304
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:20,890
(loud applause and cheering)

305
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,560
so let me word that not in a negative way,

306
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,793
but in a positive way.

307
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,040
Reinstate the fear and love of God and eliminate the fear

308
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,300
and love of everything else.

309
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,520
(loud applause and cheering)

310
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,410
What I got that from, that slight difference of wording,

311
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,703
I got that from Joel.

312
00:16:41,924 --> 00:16:45,674
(loud applause and cheering)

313
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,300
Because,

314
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,100
there's a lot of people in the Christian community

315
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,820
that try to give Joel a hard time because when you turn on

316
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,874
the radio, he keeps on showing you good God is.

317
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:05,624
(loud applause and cheering)

318
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:23,690
God is not the enemy, God is not the negative part.

319
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,470
God is not just a perception of fire and brimstone,

320
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,010
God is love, is the greatest, is the glory.

321
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,020
God is family.

322
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,800
God is friendship, God is prosperity.

323
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,460
Keep our eye on the sparrow, keep your eye on

324
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,120
the beauty and the love and the grace of God.

325
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,140
The grace that allows us to be here today

326
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,270
with all of our sins.

327
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,103
That,

328
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,540
we know that when we accept Jesus Christ

329
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,540
as our Lord and savior, we will be granted eternal life.

330
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:03,961
(loud applause and cheering)

331
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:07,447
- That's so good, I love that.

332
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:10,780
When you got Kanye defending you, you made it man,

333
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,667
all right, okay.

334
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,886
(loud applause and cheering)

335
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,710
a couple more, because I wanna stay on that Kanye

336
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,770
because it's not just about turning over a new leaf.

337
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,080
It's not just about, you know, being good or being positive

338
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,370
it's about a personal relationship with Jesus.

339
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,550
Knowing that he died for our sins, we repent of those sins

340
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,467
and we say, God I'm gonna walk with you.

341
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:34,840
You know Kanye, you can speak to that, I don't know

342
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,080
if you wanna pray for the people or I'll pray for them

343
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,330
or however you wanna do that.

344
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,920
But let's just make sure, you know the main point is,

345
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,570
what you stand for is, not just you've turned over

346
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,403
a new leaf.

347
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:47,260
You told James Corden and I don't wanna steal your words

348
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,260
but James Corden said, well how do we know Kanye is just not

349
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,120
you know, it's just not for a minute or something like that?

350
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,410
You said, you know, when you're asleep, that's one state.

351
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,950
When you wake up that's another state and Kanye said,

352
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,793
I woke up to God, so I'm awake now so I love that.

353
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:05,020
That's powerful (loud applause and cheering)

354
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,930
you wanna say anything, you wanna pray over them,

355
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,910
