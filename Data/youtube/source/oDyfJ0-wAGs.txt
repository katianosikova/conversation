1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:03,566
- How do you think marriage has changed you, if it has?

2
00:00:03,566 --> 00:00:05,933
- I've definitely learned how to compromise more.

3
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:07,700
- Uh-huh.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,533
- Which is something you have to understand

5
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:10,966
when you partner with people in business.

6
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:13,500
- Mm-hmm. - You know, you can't--

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,733
- Beautiful.

8
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:17,100
- And I've learned how to shut up more

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,866
and, um, I've--yeah.

10
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:25,266
I think--I think I'm a better human being,

11
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:27,600
you know, because of her and because of my daughter.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,900
- Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,233
- And I have, you know, always someone to think about

14
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,700
going home to and, you know,

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,566
something for me to, you know,

16
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:38,233
not only be brave for what I wanna do for humanity

17
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:42,300
but also to be more protective of myself for my family too.

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,200
'Cause there's things I've done in the past

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,500
that were considered negative, but I was really, you know,

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,366
jumping in front of the tank for other people

21
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:50,966
or for culture in a way.

22
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:52,933
So now I always have to have that in my mind,

23
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:54,700
that I have, like, a family that I have to protect too.

24
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,066
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I do see that change in you.

25
00:00:57,066 --> 00:00:59,466
I see you-- And you are calmer, I think.

26
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:03,766
You know, you don't seem, like, uh...

27
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:08,766
like, uh...angry or--you know?

28
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:09,933
You know what I mean?

29
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:11,266
And I don't know if it was even anger,

30
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:12,866
but it was just the way that you were getting

31
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,133
all of your emotions out.

32
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:17,633
And now I think your emotions are grounded in a way

33
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,700
that they come out in what you said

34
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,666
and protection and love, and--and--they're going--

35
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,166
they're channeled in a different way.

36
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,800
- I think I was, like, going through now, like,

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,600
my version of my terrible twos.

38
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,333
My--my daughter, she wants to express herself,

39
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,533
but she just doesn't have the words for it.

40
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:37,500
And for me, there's so many things I wanna do with film,

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,466
with clothing, and I just didn't have the words

42
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,766
or the resources or the backing

43
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:45,200
or the perception that I could do it,

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,266
being that I was a rapper or, you know, all these things.

45
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:52,266
And now, because of this Adidas deal,

46
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:54,300
they allowed me a little bit of oxygen.

47
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,800
Because what you have to understand--

48
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,000
The difference between, you know,

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,266
what people give you about celebrity,

50
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,666
the idea of money versus creativity.

51
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,200
There's no amount of money that someone can give you

52
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,166
to make you not be creative, if you were born to create.

53
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:09,200
So a lot of times people try to block you,

54
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,333
block your creativity, control you with money.

55
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:16,433
And Adidas allowed me to make my whole clothing line,

56
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:17,633
which I wanted to do,

57
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,700
and it was just like a little bit of oxygen.

58
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,200
You guys last year, two years ago, three--whatever.

59
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,433
You guys were seeing someone being suffocated

60
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:27,000
by a perception.

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,600
Being suffocated by people in a position

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,966
that could blatantly see like,

63
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:33,200
Wow, the "Yeezus" did really good.

64
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,666
He was this influential. All those albums did this.

65
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,000
But we're not gonna give him a shot in something else.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,600
And there's a lot of people who, like,

67
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,533
were really calm about that.

68
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:44,233
But the definition of crazy

69
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:46,633
is trying to do the same thing

70
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,600
and expecting a different result.

71
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,633
So I tried something different over the past couple years.

72
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:55,166
And I actually got some really good results from it too, so...

73
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,566
- Yeah. Well...

74
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:59,366
[cheers and applause]

75
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,933
Well put. Well put.

76
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,466
- [indistinct]

77
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:06,766
- And that is true.

78
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:08,700
I mean, I think we all try to express ourselves.

79
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,500
And you do, you keep doing the same thing

80
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,000
and saying the same thing and saying the same thing.

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,800
It doesn't get the result you want

82
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,300
until you try a different way of expressing yourself

83
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,666
or whatever it is,

84
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,666
and then you get the result because you've shifted.

85
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,933
We have to take a break.

86
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,733
And then we're gonna show the world premiere

87
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,833
of your new video, which I absolutely love.

88
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,333
I love this song so much.

89
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,433
You actually played it for me in our living room,

90
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:32,166
and I just was blown away how beautiful the song is.

91
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,766
So, uh, more kids?

92
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:36,600
- Yeah, we're trying. - Really?

93
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,800
- Yeah, yeah.

94
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,633
- I thought I'd slip that in there.

95
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:44,800
I mean, that baby is so adorable,

96
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,866
and, I mean, she is precious.

97
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:49,300
She's so-- And smart as can be, right?

98
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,533
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah, she's--

99
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,033
Oh, look at that.

100
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,200
So you're gonna have more?

101
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,066
How many do you want, like a bunch?

102
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:58,733
Like a Brad and Angie bunch? Or, uh--

103
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:01,566
- I just want whatever Kim wants.

104
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:02,700
[cheers and applause]

105
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,500
- Wow. - Yeah.

106
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,433
- Um...

107
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:12,266
That's--that's a good answer, whether it's true or not.

108
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,966
And what is the name of the CD?

109
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:16,300
- I don't know yet.

110
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,700
We're still trying to find it.

111
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,366
- Really? - Trying to find the vibe.

112
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:23,433
You know, this transition from what I felt when I did "Yeezus"

113
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:26,533
to what I feel now, and, you know, we're just creating.

114
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,800
So we haven't found it yet.

115
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,333
- Okay. What about "Ellen's My Friend"?

116
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,700
- Yeah. I think that's pretty good.

117
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,366
- Okay, think about that.
