back in 2015 uh

a few days before the mtv awards it just

37
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,160
it hit me in the shower

39
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,680
and when i first thought of it i just

41
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,280
started

43
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,640
like laughing to myself and it

45
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,840
like all this like joy came over my

47
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,399
over my body just through my soul and

49
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,960
i could just i i just felt that energy i

51
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,360
felt that spirit so then two days later

53
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,479
i uh accepted the michael jackson video

55
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,680
vanguard awards

57
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:15,040
at the uh mtv awards and um

59
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,560
instead of performing you know my array

61
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,320
of hit songs

63
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,759
you know i gave uh just my perspective

65
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,560
on award shows

67
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
but always i knew at the end i was going

69
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,840
to tell people i'm running for

71
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,439
office i'm running for president in

73
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,560
2020.

75
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,640
and you know just to have the

77
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,880
it it even took heart to say it in that

79
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,040
context and people were just like oh

81
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,640
like their their minds are blown

83
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,439
and then i was hanging out with

85
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,320
different i had different friends

87
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,119
that were you know some people in the

89
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,280
music industry

91
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,240
some people tech elites different things

93
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,680
like that and

95
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,759
they would um really

97
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,119
you know they just really took it as a

99
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,799
joke

101
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,399
and they're telling me all these

103
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,840
millions of reasons why i couldn't run

105
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,560
for president i remember running into

107
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,799
oprah

109
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,640
two days or one day after that and she's

111
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,280
like yeah i want to be president and

113
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,120
you know people just you know thought

115
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,239
projecting putting this on you

117
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,440
and i i remember saying uh one of my

119
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,200
responses

121
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,480
to one of the people that one of the

123
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,680
naysayers was

125
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,400
well definitely be a billionaire by

127
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,760
that time uh and not that that's a

129
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
reason why someone should

131
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,680
become president but it's to say you

133
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,040
know

135
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,480
at that time i was uh

137
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,519
50 around 50 million dollars in debt

139
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,080
and i knew i had the confidence

141
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,040
that i would be able to turn that around

143
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,480
and

145
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,560
now you know just going into

147
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,920
i want to just give you a a yeah that

149
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,040
that's a clear answer

151
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,160
right someone i know what you're saying

153
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
i don't i don't want to go off on two of

155
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,400
them no it's okay

157
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,760
yeah what you're basically saying is you

159
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,560
know how to set goals you know to

161
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,800
achieve them

163
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,000
but what was oprah's rationale when she

165
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,519
said you don't want to be the president

167
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,440
like what was she saying because i

169
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,720
remember when people were saying that

171
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,040
that's our next president

173
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,800
remember when trump got elected you know

175
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,360
they showed oprah and they were saying

177
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,760
like there

179
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,519
was i believe it was like nbc tweeted it

181
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,599
this is our next president

183
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,280
like they a lot of people wanted oprah

185
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,480
to want to run and they felt like if

187
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,120
trump could win

189
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,760
oprah could win when i saw trump win i

191
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,040
was like

193
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,440
see you can win

195
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,040
you know i was um you can win if you're

197
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,080
coming from outside of politics i was

199
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,080
young when ronald reagan

201
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,360
was in was president i don't remember

203
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,799
ronald reagan was the governor of

205
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,159
california before he was the president

207
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,040
he had actually proven himself as a

209
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,120
politician

211
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,959
at least somewhat which is an idea that

213
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,440
people have thrown out at me

215
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,799
to to be governor california to be

217
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,840
governor of california

219
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,120
anyone's better than this guy

221
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
just do just go ahead start there get a

223
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,480
shot

225
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,879
open things up again man but i think and

227
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
i think

229
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,920
my calling is to be uh i i

231
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,200
believe that my calling is to be

233
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,439
the leader of the free world not not

235
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,519
i mean if if it's in god's plan that

237
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,680
part of my path is to be

239
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,959
the governor then that's fine but my

241
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,320
call is to be the leader of the free

243
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,000
world so when you say this like when you

245
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,639
say your calling is to be the leader of

247
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,320
the free world

249
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,240
what what does that mean to you does

251
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,120
that does it mean do you have a plan

253
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,320
that's different

255
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,400
than the plans that have been

257
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,400
implemented before does it mean that

259
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080
you have ideas what kind of plan like

261
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,880
the plan to be the leader like what

263
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,040
would you do

265
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,639
if you were the leader of the free world

267
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,080
like what would be different about the

269
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,080
way you would handle things

271
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,800
like if that's your plan like what is it

273
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,560
about that that that is your calling

275
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,479
like why why would you want to do that

277
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,880
like what do you want to do differently

279
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,240
if you were the leader of the free world

281
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,440
well

283
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,479
um well there was a couple questions in

285
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,400
there you said why is

287
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,160
you know why is that your calling

289
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,199
there's people who will say to me

291
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,680
you know they'll say well music is

293
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,520
bigger than politics or more influential

295
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,800
than politics or celebrities or more

297
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,400
influential

299
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,280
and uh i thought of it like if i was a

301
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,080
pastor

303
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,120
of a hundred thousand person church but

305
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,720
then i was also

307
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,520
um uh a captain a sailor

309
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,160
and then we went to war and i said i'm

311
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,240
gonna

313
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,240
man this ship that has a thousand people

315
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,240
a thousand soldiers on it because god is

317
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,800
calling me

319
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,840
to take this position even though

321
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,520
i'm the pastor for you know

323
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,160
however big my audience is in hip-hop

325
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,520
uh in music or as a just an influencer

327
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,639
or celebrity

329
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,479
uh or just as a dad

331
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,840
and a husband in my house

333
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,840
the world is like

335
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,600
there couldn't be a better time to put a

337
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,160
visionary

339
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,759
in the in the captain's chair um

341
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,280
and that's not to say we we haven't had

343
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,800
visionaries be

345
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,319
uh before i'm not coming here to down

347
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,520
any of the other uh i'm not here to down

349
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,080
trump down biden uh i'm just here to

351
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,639
express

353
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:25,039
why um

355
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,880
uh why god has called me

357
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,800
to take this position so when you say a

359
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,880
visionary you think of yourself

361
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,520
in in terms of like as an artist as a

363
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,680
creator some someone who has

365
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,080
these thoughts that they manifest in in

367
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,280
terms of music and art creation design

369
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,360
the things that you do

371
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,319
that's why you you think you're

373
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,520
different

375
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,800
as a visionary yeah i

377
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,319
i i think that i think i'm different

379
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,080
from

381
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,120
i mean we're all different so i'm

383
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,639
definitely different from everybody

385
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,440
we're all different from each other

387
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,080
i mean i do bump into people that seem

389
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,720
to be like the same character inside of

391
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,240
yeah it's like i've said people before

393
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
yeah people play the same roles like

395
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,440
well i just met you before that you're

397
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,039
just like the head of this company over

399
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,960
here you're the same kind of person

401
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:16,000
um yeah you know i mean i manifest

403
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,280
i see things i'm a great leader

405
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,400
because i listen and i'm empathetic

407
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,759
and i feel the entire

409
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,319
earth and i feel us as a as a species

411
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,160
as the the human race like i do

413
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,680
sometimes people think of

415
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,000
uh utopia as almost like a negative word

417
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,880
that's

419
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,319
that's like we couldn't have that but i

421
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,120
do believe in

423
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,440
world peace like the people hit me with

425
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
the

427
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,720
one of the things oprah said is she said

429
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,240
you got to bone up on your foreign

431
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
affairs i remember this

433
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,199
like because it's oprah talking so i'm

435
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,800
going to remember a lot of what the

437
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,520
conversation was but that's the first

439
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,360
thing

441
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,000
she said was you know uh foreign affairs

443
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,319
and

445
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,120
foreign policies like just i think the

447
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,080
reason why i say

449
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,199
leader and that politician and not even

451
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,520
specifically uh

453
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,440
president is uh

455
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,560
this is the time you know when when the

457
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,160
constitution

459
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,680
was written that was an innovation now

461
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,280
the world is innovated

463
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,919
all around our political system

465
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,080
but we haven't innovated and simplified

467
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,720
our political system so i met with

469
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,199
um this gentleman sam uh one of the

471
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,800
founders of y combinator so y combinator

473
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,839
is a a um

475
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,519
is a contract that my friend the head of

477
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,680
dropbox used

479
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,440
um and that a lot of tech guys use and

481
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,240
it's a standardized deal

483
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,000
so one of the ideas i had when i was um

485
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,279
as i'm in this process of innovating i'm

487
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,279
not i'm not in

489
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,959
war with the music industry it's just

491
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,320
it's time for us to innovate

493
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,240
uh and we need to have contracts that

495
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,600
make sense with exactly how we sell

497
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,920
music so

499
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,640
you know people every vicinia and that's

501
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,440
like uh

503
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,720
every 20 years that's like the like

505
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,279
decade is 10

507
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,959
vicinia is 20. and as you see now it's

509
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,720
like the world is just

511
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,800
stopped for a second and there's an

513
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,480
opportunity to look

515
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
and say what are the things we need what

517
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,279
are the things we don't need so

519
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,279
i don't know if you saw when i posted my

521
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,800
contract i had 10 contracts

523
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,200
that kept on putting me inside a

525
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,000
labyrinth and there's things that we

527
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,920
don't need now

529
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,920
i believe that the distribution

531
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,360
partner that the label is like prince

533
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,959
would go and say

535
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,480
oh we don't need the distribution

537
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,279
partner especially if prince

539
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,839
was you know really alive and thriving

541
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,959
in this

543
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,080
internet era i'm the kind of person

545
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,720
where

547
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,519
i'm not trying to go and eliminate

549
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,720
anyone's

551
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,720
job so record labels are afraid of

553
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,920
saying okay we're going to hand over the

555
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,920
distribution

557
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,560
completely to you guys which is you know

559
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,640
that's a possibility

561
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,880
there's a way where both parties

563
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,720
can be happy and that these

565
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,160
infrastructure partners can be

567
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,760
of service to the influencer

569
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,000
to the artists like these these deals

571
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,600
can be

573
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,959
flipped in a way that they're just more

575
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,959
fair uh you know

577
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,200
a record and i'll just let let me just

579
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,399
go into the specific uh

581
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,079
place with the record labels for a

583
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,519
second yeah i'm talking about that this

585
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,240
is a confusing thing for people on the

587
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,000
outside

589
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,959
yeah so before when i told my father i

591
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,160
wanted to rap

593
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:43,440
he was uh very like

595
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,600
leery of that idea he said this

597
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,800
this i heard this business is terrible

599
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,360
and

601
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,200
you know he's right like people are all

603
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,240
seeing things that are wrong inside of

605
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
contracts

607
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,480
turning blind eyes to it and everyone's

609
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,640
responsible

611
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,000
everyone's a part of it you know it's

613
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,800
like when the me too movement

615
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,480
happened you know it wasn't just the

617
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,240
guys that were getting tagged and

619
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,920
you know some of the guys should have

621
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,040
got hit with it some guys shouldn't

623
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,279
you know that's not what i'm here to

625
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,480
talk about i'm saying that

627
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,560
in a way everyone's responsible

629
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,079
everyone's a part of the problem that's

631
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,560
why i really love that um

633
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,640
black mirror episode when you know

635
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,880
everyone was making comments

637
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,800
and anyone that even made a comment the

639
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,200
bees it was about these uh

641
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,240
you know uh mechanical bees anyone and

643
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,600
this is a spoiler

645
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,320
alert if you haven't seen this episode

647
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,640
but anyone who made a comment

649
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,399
the bees came to go get them and that's

651
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,399
the thing about what you put in the

653
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,600
universe even a thought

655
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,320
you know you put that thought into the

657
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,920
it's another thing to say something

659
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,920
negative and put that into the universe

661
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,560
it's another thing to see

663
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,079
someone being raped you know that's the

665
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,560
reason why i compare what's happening

667
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,399
to in the music industry to me too

669
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,839
because artists are raped you've heard

671
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,680
that term before i'm not this is not

673
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,079
like i'm it's not like a

675
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,800
new thing that i'm making up the the

677
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,560
contracts are made to rape

679
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:14,800
the artist and um

681
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,279
you know i put my like i i think about

683
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,880
you know this is like a thought that

685
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,320
right now it's like is this a

687
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,839
a negative thought that i'm putting into

689
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,200
the universe but i have to say like when

691
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,279
i was going on twitter i was thinking

693
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,160
about bruce and brandon lee

695
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,279
that crossed my mind to say i'm this is

697
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,639
sony

699
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:36,240
this is universal and i'm willing

701
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:41,519
to put the blue paint on my face

703
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:44,639
and go out and do this

705
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,720
because it's the right thing to do like

707
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,399
music like at this point it loses me

709
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,360
money it doesn't make

711
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,800
it doesn't make me money it is my my

713
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,959
five billion dollar

715
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,920
net worth and 300 million dollars of

717
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,079
cash that i see

719
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,560
a year music is like negative 4 million

721
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,760
for me so these contracts for me were

723
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,560
kind of like wang grow

725
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,160
and heat where this guy had everything

727
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,279
but he still said

729
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,440
wang grow messed up this this

731
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,200
uh this heist that we're going to do

733
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,720
like i look at the music industry and

735
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,399
that music and the love of music itself

737
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,120
but the music industry i look at it like

739
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:27,440
wang girl like i blame

741
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:31,360
you know the loss of my mother

743
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,800
partially on in the entertainment

745
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,399
industry the always fighting

747
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,199

against media entertainment in an

753
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,000
industry that's trying to tear down

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,920
and brandon lee like what i lost you

779
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,800

bruce lee and brandon lee were both

783
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,800
murdered

785
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,160
well brandon lee died in an accident on

787
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,720
a movie set

789
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,639
yeah do you think it was a murder i felt

791
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,600
that's a conspiracy right the conspiracy

793
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,519
was that the

795
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,959
chinese triad killed him the same way

797
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,199
they killed bruce but

799
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,320
this the the coroner's report was that

801
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,240
bruce died

803
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,320
from uh a reaction to a medication right

805
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,839
yeah i mean but i think about that

807
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,199
anytime i go to the

809
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,800
go to the hospital i'm very you know i'm

811
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,279
mindful of that stuff you think about

813
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,360
like

815
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,600
bob marley they didn't just jfk or mlk

817
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,639
him there's like reports that it was

819
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,880
something in his toe

821
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,920
or he had cancer right i believe he had

823
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,199
a skin cancer

825
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,880
yeah like i went to go

827
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,399
uh i got a shot in my uh in my hand

829
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,240
because uh just from texting and stuff

831
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,480
my thumb was like hurt and then i told

833
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,560
you

835
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,560
so much you hurt your thumb absolutely

837
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,760
just texting way too much

839
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,519
so i post a picture

841
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:15,760
of uh the screen at the hospital

843
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,760
and then i was asked to take it down

845
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,199
by but who people just call them i

847
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,519
forget

849
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,040
exactly who asked me but it was like

851
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,160
they get they got to my management they

853
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,360
got to this and they said take that

855
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,680
picture down

857
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,720
like the hospital it was in the weirdest

859
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,040
place

861
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,399
you know so what what did they not like

863
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,519
about the picture

865
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,839
um i think it had like it might have had

867
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,000
some

869
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,880
information on it that they didn't want

871
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,360
to go out like an

873
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,360
address or something like that it's just

875
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,720
like but i don't want to go down

877
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,279
go down these rabbit holes i'm just

879
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,079
saying like michael jackson

881
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,440
not waking up one day prince not waking

883
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,720
up one day

885
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,399
bruce and brandon lee bob marley all of

887
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,440
these things

889
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,320
are have crossed my mind you know

891
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,279
as i'm going and saying i need to

893
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,800
innovate

895
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:09,680
what these contracts are not just for me

897
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,800
but for all artists it's not about me

899
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,920
getting my

901
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:18,000
masters back it's about

903
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,199
it's about freedom and i say on a new

905
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,680
song i say

907
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,839
if i would put myself in harm's way to

909
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,880
get my masters they would put their self

911
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,320
in harm's way

913
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,560
to stay the master and that's there's a

915
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,920
complete parallel to the way the music

917
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,800
industry works

919
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,000
and the way the world currently works

921
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,079
and the influence that

923
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,959
america has on other countries

925
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,600
and the way governments work uh the

927
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,839
influence

929
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,199
and the way government and the way

931
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,959
people in power

933
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:53,279
and control deal with

935
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,079
you know disaster relief deal deal with

937
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,279
haiti

939
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,240
deal with uh the bahamas

941
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,120
like where is the money going why aren't

943
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,799
things

945
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,839
being built and this concept of money

947
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:11,280
right i asked myself this um

949
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,439
uh i asked someone a week ago

951
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,600
like how much is america in debt and

953
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,280
they were like this many trillion

955
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,720
and then i asked my a rhetorical

957
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,400
question but the dumbest question i've

959
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,079
ever asked myself i said

961
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,240
well you know how much does the earth

963
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,919
cost

965
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,679
think of it think about a bad question

967
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,840
but but how much is the earth worth

969
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,720
yeah what is what is the earth what all

971
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,679
the things on earth

973
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,280
yeah and it's saying we can't buy it we

975
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,160
couldn't make enough money

977
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,280
to buy the earth right so that means we

979
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,320
made money

981
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,080
so if money is the key to

983
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,280
all people's happiness and we'll solve

985
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
everything and everyone's doing things

987
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,240
for money

989
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,760
let's just make more money but it's not

991
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,960
about making more money

993
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,840
it's about keeping poor people poor

995
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,039
and rich people rich and people keeping

997
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,679
people in their place

999
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,799
and right now we're experiencing the

1001
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,919
fall of rome

1003
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,360
or the titanic has now hit a glacier and

1005
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,280
there's people who

1007
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,200
would prefer to go down with the titanic

1009
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,640
than to get on a lifeboat because they

1011
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,480
don't want to get sea water on their

1013
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,600
dress or on a nice outfit

1015
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,640
the people are so programmed and

1017
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,880
brainwashed

1019
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:26,960
into uh classism and protectionism

1021
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,160
that uh it's difficult

1023
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,280
for people to embrace innovation

1025
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,120
unless it has a tag on it

1027
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,039
it's got a name brand connected to it

1029
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,039
that says with this innovation you will

1031
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,400
be better than the person

1033
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,480
you'll be better than your next-door

1035
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,919
neighbor you know when i made sunday

1037
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,400
service

1039
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,600
i i completely stopped rapping because i

1041
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,160
didn't know how to rap

1043
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,840
for god you know all my raps always had

1045
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,000
like um

1047
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:59,760
you know like nasty jokes on it and um

1049
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,400
and then you know i made um

1051
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,760
i made uh when i when i went to the

1053
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,600
hospital i know you want to get into

1055
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,280
this when i went to the hospital

1057
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,400
in 2016 i wrote

1059
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,280
uh start a church in calabasas and

1061
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,679
as we left from 2018 going into 2019 i

1063
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,679
said i'm not gonna let one sunday go by

1065
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,200
without starting this church and there's

1067
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,320
people who said it wasn't a church and

1069
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,160
different things but

1071
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,520
to start a ministry i'm like the little

1073
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,440
drummer boy where i'm saying

1075
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,960
you know this all i got to bring my my

1077
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,600
drum i might not be

1079
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,120
well versed in the word and but i i know

1081
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,480
how to do make music and i know how to

1083
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,840
put this choir together

1085
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,559
and all things can be made good for god

1087
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,880
so

1089
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,640
it like quickly became the best choir of

1091
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,559
all time because all the best singers

1093
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,400
moved to california

1095
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,400
and now but a lot of them grew up in the

1097
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,840
church so it's like the opportunity

1099
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,400
for for them to actually get paid

1101
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,240
singing

1103
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,160
for god because i would be funding it

1105
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,640
and that for me was like a tithe

1107
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,440
for me to fund sunday service and i was

1109
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,520
four months in before i gave my life

1111
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,480
to god like i wasn't saved it's just i

1113
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,520
had a calling

1115
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,640
saying just go make this church and the

1117
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,440
whole thing

1119
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,640
the comparison to this church to me

1121
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,320
going and saying

1123
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,640
okay why why am i running for president

1125
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,880
is to be in service and that's service

1127
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,320
to my my own ego

1129
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,840
uh you know i feel like god says to me

1131
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,039
like

1133
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,159
haven't i given you enough and i gave

1135
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,039
you an ego

1137
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,039
that helped you overcome all these you

1139
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,240
know roadblocks and smoke screens and

1141
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,600
people telling you

1143
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,520
what you can't do now you need to

1145
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,880
realize when you're doing things for

1147
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,320
your ego and when you're doing things

1149
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,159
for me this is like

1151
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,799
god the what i feel god is saying to me

1153
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,840
uh because it really irritates me when

1155
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,200
people say

1157
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,520
god told me to tell you so

1159
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,039
i'm very like mindful with this kind of

1161
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,960
word and this i'm saying i have a

1163
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:02,640
feeling that that's what god is saying

1165
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:06,640
for me to be in service so

1167
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,159
the ultimate service position is

1169
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,840
leader of the free world to be the

1171
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,520
president of the united states it's

1173
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,880
sometimes you see me on twitter i'll say

1175
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,720
i want all the smoke i want all the

1177
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,159
problems because the problems

1179
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,799
are the opportunities there's an

1181
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,760
opportunity to solve things

1183
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,799
and kurzweil uh he created the keyboard

1185
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,679
kurzweil

1187
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:30,000
uh he he has this video that marco manik

1189
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,440
this uh director that shot 99 problems

1191
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,440
for jay-z which is like

1193
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,760
my favorite uh maybe like top five or

1195
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,360
top two favorite videos of all time uh

1197
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,400
he also did a

1199
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,559
closer for trent rezner and i like

1201
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,640
i just grew up on mtv in the 90s and i

1203
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,679
love mark romantic videos but he would

1205
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,559
share

1207
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,600
um he'd share little bits and pieces i

1209
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,480
remember ray curls

1211
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,200
kurzweil talking about the ability for

1213
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,039
us to have

1215
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,840
a utopia but us being led by the least

1217
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,840
noble

1219
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,240
and the most greedy but if

1221
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,679
someone or when someone gets in a

1223
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,440
position

1225
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:15,280
of leadership that

1227
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,559
is in service to god and in service

1229
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:22,799
to people period but

1231
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,640
immediately the american people um

1233
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,720
i had this joke i was saying like man no

1235
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,400
one outside of our country should be

1237
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,799
able to see these debates this is family

1239
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,559
business right here this is only for

1241
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,640
america to see we can't let anyone

1243
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:38,320
outside the country see it but

1245
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:41,679
to be in service so i i stepped away

1247
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,039
already from my rap career for

1249
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,520
a year and served

1251
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,559
god every week sometimes twice a week

1253
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,760
three times a week

1255
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:54,960
never missed a sunday until covet

1257
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,120
and um and this thing there were people

1259
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,559
inside of the church stealing

1261
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,400
doing different things trying to just

1263
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,159
take them and god still provided a way

1265
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,360
for us to keep that boat

1267
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,559
afloat we never missed a we never missed

1269
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,080
uh a service and then uh one of my

1271
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:14,640
pastors pastor adam

1273
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,320
who is uh uh uh

1275
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,760
the way he preaches is is called

1277
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,240
expository it's like

1279
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,200
one to one by the word i like all

1281
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,880
different kind of preachers but there's

1283
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,480
some type of preachers they

1285
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,000
they get up they have the bible in their

1287
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,280
hand then they close the bible and then

1289
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,360
they just talk for

1291
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,960
uh two hours and it's and and

1293
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,960
some do have anointing but the

1295
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,720
expository preachers go

1297
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,240
line for line and for me it's like i

1299
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,720
come from entertainment

1301
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,279
i got so much sauce i don't need no

1303
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,440
sauce

1305
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,400
on the word i need the word to be solid

1307
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,799
food

1309
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,799
that i can understand exactly what god

1311
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,520
was saying to me through

1313
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,880
the king james version do this you know

1315
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,799
um

1317
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,720
through this translation or the english

1319
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,600
shannon version so pastor adams was

1321
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,880
coming by

1323
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,279
my spot uh i got this 300 acre spot in

1325
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,480
um

1327
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:07,760
calabasas uh that we had a little house

1329
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,240
in that i was recording and i would play

1331
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,000
this

1333
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,840
music these chords that i love they're

1335
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,440
almost like monk-like

1337
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,880
um and that's going to go into something

1339
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,760
we'll talk about later because i'm

1341
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,039
building a modest i'm building them a

1343
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,000
monastery that will

1345
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,799
then be the future of uh monasteries

1347
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,080
this like

1349
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:29,360
uh full sustainable energy now

1351
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,880
uh he says to me pastor adam says to me

1353
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,279
when i was thinking about should i rap

1355
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,440
or not he said my son

1357
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,840
just said you know i wish i want to hear

1359
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,120
yay rap do album about jesus a rap album

1361
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,840
about jesus and it was

1363
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,320
through the mouth of babes like this

1365
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,159
person

1367
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,159
i'm gonna listen to the kids bro you

1369
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,120

1371
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,080
i'm gonna listen to kids before i listen

1373
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,279
to

1375
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,919
you know super programmed out adults

1377
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,880
and especially if that adult hasn't done

1379
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,559
something that

1381
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,679
i am looking to do right uh so it's so

1383
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,760
funny how people are so

1385
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,760
like free and almost arrogant with their

1387
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,720
advice and i'm just like

1389
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,400
why would i listen to you you don't even

1391
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,080
ask me for any advice i'm the most

1393
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,440
successful person i know so

1395
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,520
the um um

1397
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,200
so he said my son wants to hear a rap

1399
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,200
album from yay

1401
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,480
and that just that was that was the

1403
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,400
paradigm shift

1405
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,080
for me i used that word a lot i like

1407
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,799
that i like paradigm shift it's one of

1409
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,240
my favorite

1411
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:33,919
the and i i made this rap album

1413
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,880
and you know for a lot of people it was

1415
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,400
the first

1417
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,240
album that they could play with a

1419
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,960
certain production level

1421
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,840
in the house with their with their with

1423
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,279
their family

1425
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,919
now you know you could argue if the

1427
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:49,200
watch the throne production

1429
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:52,880
was stronger or better than

1431
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,640
uh jesus king production but when i go

1433
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,760
and i like i've been working with dr dre

1435
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,240
and some of the beats and just be like

1437
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,720
you know

1439
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,240
the hardest beats possible and it's

1441
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,440
something that was very

1443
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,640
spiritual and meditative about

1445
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:10,480
the mix on jesus king that it wasn't

1447
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,440
hitting as hard as jesus or hitting as

1449
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,200
hard as uh

1451
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,000
watch the throne it was like this is how

1453
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,120
god wanted me to make this

1455
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,960
uh make this sonic painting

1457
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,640
and the way he wanted me to communicate

1459
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,679
then so we did that album

1461
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,279
and then we did the jesus's born album

1463
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,000
which also i got that idea from pastor

1465
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,039
adams

1467
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,520
uh and

1469
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,360
i mean there's people who that's the

1471
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,760
only album they play

1473
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,200
and it's just bringing these gospel and

1475
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,760
i tell you like my formula for these

1477
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,120
hymns i'm writing because i'm writing

1479
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,559
the the songs that we're doing at uh

1481
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:52,000
sunday service is basically my

1483
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:55,200
book of hymns for the future gospel

1485
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,320
university that i'm creating where

1487
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,840
i've envisioned and will manifest

1489
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:05,039
a 200 000 seat stadium

1491
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,279
circular with a hundred thousand

1493
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,720
gospel singers and people will go to

1495
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,240
this university

1497
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,520
and they will train the way you know a

1499
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,039
russian olympic swimmer

1501
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,600
you know a picture like they would be in

1503
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,080
the pool six days a week at least

1505
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,760
if not seven days but for people who

1507
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,600
sing for the church or

1509
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,520
you know uh you know because it's

1511
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,640
it's it's a tide it's pro bonus all this

1513
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,760
like people

1515
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,240
don't practice that as much as we

1517
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,120
practice

1519
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,200
going to studio to rap or practice uh

1521
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,039
playing basketball if we're in the nba

1523
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,399
so it's making the nba sort of say

1525
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,640
uh the coliseum for god and what that

1527
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,440
have

1529
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,559
have you like heard like soccer chants

1531
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,360
and like

1533
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,039
and just like sixty thousand persons so

1535
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,159
i envisioned that

1537
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,480
for god a hundred thousand people

1539
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,600
sometimes singing in uh harmony

1541
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,440
sometimes in

1543
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,960
unison glory glory

1545
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,440
oh god almighty we lift

1547
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:14,559
our hands and give you

1549
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:18,720
praise glory glory

1551
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:23,600
oh god almighty we lift our

1553
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:26,880
hands and give you praise

1555
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,799
for picture a hundred thousand people

1557
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,159
in unison and that feeling what that

1559
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:35,279
would do for our spirits our souls it's

1561
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,000
healing there's natural forms of healing

1563
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,200
about

1565
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,360
our environment um the friends

1567
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,640
that we're around what we're wearing

1569
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,000
what we're eating

1571
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:49,039
our diet so donde is a design company

1573
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,240
that um that uh

1575
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,159
i formed around 10 years ago and

1577
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,600
some of the people that worked at donda

1579
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,840
are now have went on

1581
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,760
to become heads of fashion houses like

1583
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,360
uh virgil's the head of louis vuitton

1585
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,799
and he was the head of donda

1587
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,720
at a certain point another guy that

1589
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,840
worked at donda is now the head of

1591
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,039
givenchy

1593
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,279
so this is like the the talent pool

1595
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,080
and this donda is basically my version

1597
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,200
of like a

1599
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,120
cyber you know extension of my brain

1601
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,600
like here's something that i'm thinking

1603
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,279
of that you can't touch but we need to

1605
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,720
we need to bring it into fruition we

1607
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,919
need to manifest it

1609
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,640
and we have to see how to use things of

1611
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,240
our past

1613
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,640
and things of our now to create our

1615
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,120
future so it's a

1617
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,279
organization um created to

1619
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,880
guarantee the future of the human race

1621
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,440
really i thought about even calling it

1623
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,200
edna

1625
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,120
because i see us all as superheroes and

1627
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,600
aetna was the designer

1629
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,440
in the incredibles which is kind of

1631
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,120
almost really similar to donda i'm just

1633
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,120
seeing these lineups and stuff

1635
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,840
so um so now

1637
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,919
our focus is food clothing shelter

1639
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,760
communication education and

1641
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,919
transportation so at the school that i

1643
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,760
just created easy christian academy

1645
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,840
you know we call nasa we call different

1647
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,600
places about this hydroponic

1649
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,480
vertical growing uh

1651
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,679
garden and i remember sitting you know

1653
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,240
the idea of the garden is

1655
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,039
from a to z you have to be able to make

1657
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,720
your food

1659
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,480
right there fully sustainable right

1661
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,919
there on your land and you know there's

1663
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
a bunch of people like oh i made this

1665
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,880
salad

1667
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,520
right here it's like i'm not that good

1669
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,760
enough

1671
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,200
you still gotta go to the grocery store

1673
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,559
for eighty percent

1675
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,480
sixty percent of your stuff i remember

1677
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,200
this one you know um

1679
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,000
this one farmer we had you know he

1681
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,240
wanted to build this

1683
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,520
class for the kids and all this we're

1685
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,720
going to show the kids this thing people

1687
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,799
always make the kids version

1689
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,760
i don't like this the kids version thing

1691
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,880
like

1693
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,840
kids need to understand how what if the

1695
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,279
pandemic was

1697
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,520
you know they lost all their parents and

1699
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,559
it was lost the kids need to understand

1701
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,880
early how real life works

1703
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,919
so physics is one of the anchors of the

1705
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,559
school that i'm

1707
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,240
creating i remember you know i'm uh the

1709
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,120
city is all self-sustaining so it works

1711
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,720
off of our

1713
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,320
four main resources earth wind

1715
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:13,279
uh water and and fire and

1717
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,840
uh 90 of it is running off of water with

1719
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,399
like

1721
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,360
aqueducts like the city of masada and i

1723
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,960
was talking to this

1725
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,720
engineer um and saying i need the whole

1727
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,399
thing to run off of water

1729
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,399
and he said well we're gonna have to use

1731
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,320
solar power i said

1733
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,159
i don't and please you know don't take

1735
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,480
this as any offense

1737
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,799
i don't like solar panels i feel that

1739
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,159
they're part of still of what edison's

1741
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,640
idea was i don't feel like they're

1743
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,320
really in line with what nikolai tesla

1745
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,640
really wanted to do with alternative

1747
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,960
current i mean getting into the whole

1749
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,679
tesla and what edison did to take tesla

1751
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,279
down and

1753
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,840
the fact the world would probably be

1755
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,640
free by now if ted if tesla wasn't

1757
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,559
basically destroyed by the media that

1759
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,679
edison controlled in the propaganda that

1761
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,640
edison control

1763
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,240
so i'm i'm talking to my engineer and

1765
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,080
saying this needs to run completely with

1767
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,320
water and i don't want to use

1769
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,320
uh a solar anyway and he says no i'm

1771
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,640
saying we're going to use a mirror

1773
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,159
and it's going to connect to a steam uh

1775
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,960
engine and that's going to push the

1777
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,440
water

1779
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,360
back up and i was like after like

1781
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,000
screaming at the guy i was like look if

1783
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,159
i had known

1785
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,399
physics i wouldn't have been screaming

1787
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,640
at my engineer so if we think about

1789
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,519
what we're learning in school to learn

1791
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,840
physics

1793
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,320
to learn farming i was uh i was talking

1795
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,679
to

1797
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,880
um a friend of mine that's a uh a rapper

1799
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,519
and super

1801
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,640
uh super uh god following spiritual

1803
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,799
super smart

1805
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,840
and i was showing her the um uh

1807
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,679
uh some of the designs for uh the

1809
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,120
monasteries and some of the designs for

1811
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,000
the fully sustainable communities all

1813
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,080
the same thing

1815
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,360
and then it said bioengineering on it

1817
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,679
and she said what do you

1819
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,120
she it's like for her bioengineering has

1821
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,679
a negative connotation

1823
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,720
and my response was isn't like farming

1825
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,519
and cooking

1827
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,279
like bioengineering at the at the

1829
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,120
simplest form like we went to

1831
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,799
going from like grabbing apples off of a

1833
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,760
tree to

1835
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,880
oh we put this boom in the ground oh and

1837
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,440
we could grow this and we could grow

1839
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,200
this

1841
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,559
you know we could grow this harvest

1843
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,200
right here so it's

1845
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,080
you know i want to just sim simplify and

1847
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,440
round up the

1849
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,480
the principle behind uh the donda way of

1851
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,760
thinking

1853
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,720
is we've got all this

1855
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,080
information and all this you know these

1857
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:37,360
science scientific um

1859
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,200
uh exploration these things that tesla

1861
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,360
never completed these things that

1863
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,880
da vinci never completed and

1865
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,960
we can look at all of these things and

1867
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,760
see how do we create the most

1869
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,360
primitive versions of this to create a

1871
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,440
fully sustainable ecosystem which is

1873
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,519
you know what covet actually helped us

1875
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,440
to you know get closer to our families

1877
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,240
get closer to our children

1879
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,240
uh understand like oh wow that you know

1881
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,080
that was mapped out for us to be

1883
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,560
50 minutes away from our home and our

1885
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,159
kids school to be 30 minutes away and to

1887
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,879
put us in traffic for that amount of

1889
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,679
time and

1891
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,159
these cities have been designed to

1893
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,159
promote

1895
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,000
industry and just to make more money

1897
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,960
they haven't been designed to promote

1899
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,919
happiness so

1901
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,960
we're at this paradigm shift in our

1903
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,800
existence

1905
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,159
you know it was when muhammad hit the

1907
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,599
market i think that's who it was and

1909
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,040
brought money because before it was

1911
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,760
slave and trade

1913
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,040
and this is something you know

1915
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,800
dishonorable men

1917
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,159
honor money i got this bar from dave

1919
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,599
chappelle i'm not trying to like

1921
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:43,040
steal his bar uh and you know

1923
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:46,560
we as human beings this this race on

1925
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,760
earth have like been honoring money

1927
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,200
and you know money isn't it's not even

1929
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,639
real you know it's not even backed by

1931
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,440
anything i don't want to like go too

1933
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,800
far into that but when you unprogram

1935
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,960
yourself you see that there's

1937
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,240
other forms of currency now like

1939
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,359
relationships

1941
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,720
are a more important currency than money

1943
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,320
itself and that's what

1945
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,640
we really saw it's like the end of the

1947
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,760
movie that our existence would be

1949
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,720
pre-coveted post covet and so as the

1951
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,880
titanic

1953
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,079
is crashing and sinking and rome is

1955
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,560
falling

1957
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,320
there's got to be this new civilization

1959
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,359
like the end of tron where everything

1961
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,280
starts to

1963
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,880
light up and it's been under this like

1965
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,000
dark cloud so

1967
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,560
you know god is using me

1969
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,400
and he has a calling you know in my life

1971
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,000
to make the world better for

1973
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,920
all people like people say there's bad

1975
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,760
people there's good people no there's

1977
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,320
there's there's people that are

1979
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,720
possessed that have demonic ways

1981
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,800
but we were all children at one time

1983
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,240
they say some people no they were born

1985
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,160
bad you got to remember like say oh

1987
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,920
there's bad people even even the devil's

1989
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,920
an angel

1991
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,280
a fallen angel a lost angel like

1993
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,920
los angeles if you think

1995
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,280
let me but that's the city of angels let

1997
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,640
me let me let me start

1999
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,119
from the beginning so you you

2001
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,599
essentially deconstruct things

2003
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,800
so when you say in in many ways when

2005
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,839
you're describing yourself as a

2007
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,320
visionary this is

2009
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,760
what i'm saying is you're looking at all

2011
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
the systems that are in place whether

2013
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,359
it's the

2015
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,920
record industry um the contracts that

2017
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,760
are

2019
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,680
wrong with artists the way civilization

2021
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,720
is set up i think visionaries too

2023
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,079
glossy and too saucy of a title okay

2025
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,000
whatever you're deconstructing

2027
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,359
all of these things and you find flaws

2029
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,119
in the systems

2031
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,720
so all these systems whether it's the

2033
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,320
the music industry system

2035
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,560
whether it's the political system

2037
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,640
whether it's the the system of

2039
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,160
gathering food whether even a religious

2041
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,839
system like i remember when

2043
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,200
you started doing your sunday service

2045
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,400
and my friend was like what is he doing

2047
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,560
i go

2049
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,839
he's making going to church cool again

2051
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,520
like you don't think that's look at all

2053
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,200
these people having a great time you've

2055
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,440
thousands of people that are chanting

2057
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,560
and singing along like he's not asking

2059
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,359
for anything

2061
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,560
i go look if anybody should be doing

2063
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,560
something like that it's him

2065
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,160
i go because he's making great music

2067
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,680
everybody's having a good time

2069
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,280
and what do you get out of that the best

2071
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,160
thing that people ever get out of church

2073
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,119
is sense of community a time where you

2075
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,040
get together

2077
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,240
and you all agree this is where you're

2079
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,440
going to concentrate on good

2081
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,440
you're going to concentrate on goodness

2083
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,760
you're going to concentrate on on

2085
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,119
and trying to find these shared values

2087
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,359
that are going to help the community

2089
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,960
now you're doing this in this mass form

2091
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,119
you got the superstar

2093
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,079
musician who's doing this in this mass

2095
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,520
form with

2097
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,359
thousands and thousands of people in

2099
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,040
these gigantic areas like that's

2101
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,520
nothing but positive so you

2103
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,119
deconstructed the idea of

2105
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,440
how how to do a religious service but

2107
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,359
make it cool and now you're thinking

2109
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,839
about deconstructing all these different

2111
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,920
things

2113
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,359
you're thinking about deconstructing how

2115
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,200
how food is harvested

2117
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,200
you're thinking about deconstructing how

2119
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,760
we make energy you're literally trying

2121
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,800
to

2123
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,079
deconstruct and and reimagine the idea

2125
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,359
of civilization

2127
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,880
yeah exactly so talk me through how this

2129
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,839
starts with you

2131
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,280
have you were you always religious your

2133
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,839
whole life

2135
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,470
yes i was and then i you know then i hit

2137
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,200
high school

2139
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:11,920
[Laughter]

2141
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,280
so but you you know when you're a young

2143
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,440
man and you're

2145
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,480
you know you're a superstar musician and

2147
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,720
you know you're living a wild life what

2149
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,240
what was it that led you back to this

2151
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,119
just a feeling in your life

2153
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,880
that there was more to life there was

2155
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,040
more to your position

2157
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,920
there was more to you know this idea of

2159
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,040
a calling

2161
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,839
that you felt like you could do more

2163
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,240
and that it it resonated with you more

2165
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,520
to

2167
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,400
to to produce these sunday services

2169
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,240
and to to start thinking of of life in

2171
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,800
this way like you can improve

2173
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,000
things yeah god knocked me off my horse

2175
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,440
god like

2177
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,160
literally called me and said okay

2179
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,560
now i need you i need you right now i

2181
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,200
need

2183
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,480
i mean not that god needs needs me we

2185
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,760
need god but

2187
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,680
he called me to serve him and

2189
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,280
i was tired of serving the music

2191
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,320
industry to start

2193
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,599
tired of serving you know filling up

2195
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,119
stadiums

2197
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:16,160
uh you know when the last concert

2199
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,880
last tour i did we had a floating stage

2201
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,160
and uh and actually it was a hanging

2203
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,000
stage but

2205
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,119
it looked like it was floating and

2207
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,720
that's just another thing that's

2209
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,920
illusion where we need to dispel the

2211
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,040
illusion i wouldn't even call it the

2213
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,640
floating stage today but

2215
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,560
the whole thing about is people used to

2217
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,839
say how i would lose money on tours

2219
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,720
because i would put so much into the

2221
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,040
creative

2223
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,280
and i and i was like wanted to prove but

2225
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,520

could make more

2231
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,160
than anybody and that's like the

2233
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,000
gladiator position that all

2235
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,359
artists are put into like we're in the

2237
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,359
middle of this coliseum

2239
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,520

blah

2245
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,320
than any other gladiators that happen so

2247
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,480
that's what i'm that's what i was doing

2249
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,400
and then i remember talking to james

2251
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,240
terrell and i was like

2253
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,079
at the top of my lungs like screaming

2255
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,880
about saving

2257
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,040
uh saving ourselves and humanity and the

2259
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,560
reason why me and james needed to

2261
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,920
uh connect and then i went to uh

2263
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,400
my show and then it's like my like this

2265
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,680
like my head popped back and the spirit

2267
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,319
jumped out and it felt like it was like

2269
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,280
my mom

2271
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,079
talking and the last thing i said was

2273
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,839
this thing is

2275
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:30,319
over and i'm saying it like i sound like

2277
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,680
my mom like donda like that's something

2279
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:34,960
she would have said

2281
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,680
if she was in the physical form when she

2283
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,640
sees

2285
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,079
her son you know exhausted like i just

2287
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,960
went through uh

2289
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,440
uh i had this uh fashion show we had

2291
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,839
this fashion show where we took over msg

2293
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,480
and just broke all boundaries sold 20

2295
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,440
000 16

2297
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,720
000 seats and played the new album and

2299
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,440
uh

2301
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,160
it was you know a thousand black people

2303
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,280
in the show

2305
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,880
and yeah like all young thug plugging in

2307
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,319
the iphone and

2309
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,960
uh travis and cuddy dancing he had 50

2311
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,160
cent there

2313
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,359
jay-z there lamar odom the uh the first

2315
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,480
time that people

2317
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:16,000
you know saw him and walk again

2319
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,599
uh was we walked together into the

2321
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,480
into the stadium uh and he's camo yeezy

2323
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,319
jacket

2325
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,839
all head to toe and the reason why that

2327
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,560
was so important is like when he was in

2329
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,720
a coma

2331
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,599
i would come by and play him the new

2333
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,520
music

2335
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,000
and once he was out of the coma he said

2337
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,760
that he remembered that music when he

2339
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
was in a coma and that was the album i

2341
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,640
was

2343
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
playing that day so that's the reason

2345
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,680
why me and lamar

2347
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,760
uh walked in together and then

2349
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,839
the next a few months later i did a

2351
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,720
fashion show and it started 45 minutes

2353
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,760
late

2355
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,599
and the media they just killed me

2357
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,680
they lebrond me as i would say like when

2359
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,359
lebron went to uh

2361
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,480
to um uh miami and they said you know

2363
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,160
who are you to have a

2365
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,800
a choice you know like what uh one of my

2367
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,839
other heroes tom brady he he left i

2369
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,760
didn't see no

2371
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:13,280
jerseys getting burned like when lebron

2373
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,160
uh left so then less than a week after

2375
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,440
that

2377
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:21,280
my wife is robbed in

2379
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,720
paris and so we we just because i'm i'm

2381
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,400
in the middle of a tour while i'm doing

2383
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,119
the fashion show while i'm doing this

2385
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,040
so we cancel the tour because it's it's

2387
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,079
very you know traumatic

2389
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,800
and then you know

2391
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,000
we start the tour back up and we get

2393
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,079
back into it

2395
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,119
and then i i just keep on saying i want

2397
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,119
to go to japan

2399
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,440
i just want to go to japan because japan

2401
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,160
is like a way that people treat there

2403
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,880
isn't like the systemic racism

2405
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,280
embedded in every single individual

2407
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,680
that's

2409
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,560
inside of the place like in america uh

2411
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,160
black white

2413
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:59,440
anything there's a systemic uh white

2415
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:02,240
white supremacy like when i tag you know

2417
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,640
white supremacy or we say this it's like

2419
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,000
the

2421
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,520
um yes that is america that is the world

2423
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,040
currently we've been taught that my

2425
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,560
first superhero was

2427
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,680
superman you know and my dad was a black

2429
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,319
panther

2431
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,119
but you know when disney makes black

2433
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,760
panther

2435
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,640
now when you look it up you don't see my

2437
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,839
dad

2439
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,200
protecting his neighborhood or snatching

2441
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,079
a mic out of somebody's hand while

2443
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,240
they're lying

2445
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,200
i don't know you know like father like

2447
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,520
son right there

2449
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:36,319
uh but you see this character

2451
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,920
that's made for black people to idolize

2453
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,599
that was designed by a white

2455
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,599
white person and put out by a white

2457
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,040
company so it's controlling the

2459
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,040
narrative to say

2461
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,560
we're going to show you harriet tubman

2463
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,680
we're not going to show you

2465
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,240
not turner and they do it every chance

2467
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,520
they get

2469
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,680
maleficent uh um

2471
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,880
they called her her race of people the

2473
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,920
moors

2475
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,160
and the moors are and i just saw it

2477
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,200
again i was just like yo

2479
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,640
if you erase our history like most black

2481
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,800
people we don't know

2483
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,920
or we come we think we came from slaves

2485
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,040
we don't know

2487
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,560
our bloodline and we're we're given

2489
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,960
black history month and we

2491
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,400
take that like it's some gift to us no

2493
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,000
it's a programming

2495
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,760
to us racism doesn't end until we

2497
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
get to a point where we stop having to

2499
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,160
put the word black in front of it

2501
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
because it's like we're we're putting

2503
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,800
the rim a little bit lower

2505
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,920
for ourselves like it's when i say i'm

2507
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,119
the second

2509
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,640
wealthiest black man in america

2511
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,400
like why do i have to say that because

2513
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,960
you know obviously

2515
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,480
if we just go on wealth period of what

2517
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,200
we call wealth like financial wealth

2519
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,319
that score

2521
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,680
card you know i'd be like i'm the i'm

2523
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,400
the 78th

2525
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,680
wealthiest man in america but we

2527
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,560
shouldn't have to

2529
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,319
have a special box a special month

2531
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,119
because also what they show in black

2533
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,000
black history month is us getting hosed

2535
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,319
down

2537
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,119
reminding us that we were slaves like

2539
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,200
what if we had

2541
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,440
remember when i cheated on you month

2543
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,760
like remember when you first found the

2545
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,359
found the text messages remember how

2547
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,160
does that make you feel it makes you

2549
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,599
feel

2551
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,960
depleted and defeated you know it's

2553
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,119
no matter what religion you are what we

2555
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,400
can agree on is it is always

2557
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,079
now but now is the shortest moment of

2559
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,319
our life

2561
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,359
it's gone in an instant the longest

2563
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,960
moments of our life

2565
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,560
are our memories and our imaginations

2567
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,560
think about how long a kid imagines

2569
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,640
christmas before

2571
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,920
i mean versus how long christmas really

2573
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,400
is and when you think back to your

2575
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,800
christmas

2577
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,240
are you under the table like jim carrey

2579
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,680
and eternal sunshine with a spotless

2581
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,480
mind like under a chair or are you a

2583
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,599
giant

2585
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,920
are you a king are you what blac

2587
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,839
what what black history month has told

2589
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,839
you you are and this is me

2591
00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:01,440
speaking to uh you know black people

2593
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,200
specifically in america that

2595
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,119
you know i know people who would you

2597
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,800
know kill someone

2599
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:11,280
in uh or have a gunner

2601
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,560
you know in in their own hood and be

2603
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,440
afraid to go

2605
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,640
downtown and literally be like afraid of

2607
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,760
white people

2609
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,680
like the most gangster gang of gangsters

2611
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,079
wouldn't go downtown

2613
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,079
and that's just a programming but that

2615
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,720
program is inside of the curriculum

2617
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,400
it's an instant side of the media it and

2619
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,599
it and it goes to

2621
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,119
this whole idea of yay when people say

2623
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,160
is jay crazy

2625
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:41,520
is a a narcissistic is a

2627
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,160
uh egomaniac is yay self-absorbed of jay

2629
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,079
all these

2631
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:49,359
no yay know who yay is i know who i am

2633
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:52,480
and i'm not fin i'm not fit to

2635
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:56,560
bow to uh

2637
00:46:52,480 --> 00:47:00,480
to an idea that you want to have of me i

2639
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:03,599
am going to be the full idea that god

2641
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,359
has of me and when i do things that are

2643
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,280
that god don't like

2645
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:10,640
i'm i'm i'm i'm being the lesser version

2647
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,359
of me this is where i

2649
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,240
you know in my weakness god becomes

2651
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,520
strong

2653
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:20,960
i have to be the higher me

2655
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,520
when when people are downing me it's not

2657
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,240
like

2659
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,680
me fighting fire with fire me attacking

2661
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:30,000
or as you say like

2663
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,760
you know stooping to uh

2665
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
stooping to that level it's like the

2667
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,440
devil will use

2669
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,319
you against you you become your own

2671
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,079
uh you become your own worst enemy and i

2673
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,559
just went on a riff right there but

2675
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,839
the thing is these isn't that what you

2677
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,920
do though like yeah

2679
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,079
yeah one of the things that i when

2681
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,640
anybody ever talks about you to me

2683
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,520
they they they say well he's all over

2685
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,960
the place

2687
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,119
and i say i think that he's got a

2689
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,079
different power source like if you look

2691
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,760
at the way

2693
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,440
everybody interfaces with the world if

2695
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,119
there's a universal power most people

2697
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,559
have like a 20 watt charger

2699
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,400
the way i describe you i say i think

2701
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,960
that [ __ ] got like 150 watt

2703
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,800
charger

2705
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,000
and these ideas are just coming at them

2707
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,480
so you do

2709
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,040
go on these rants that sometimes need to

2711
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:18,800
be dissected into individual things

2713
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:22,000
but overall you're incredibly productive

2715
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,440
so my question is why do you

2717
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,160
why do people think there's something

2719
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,160
wrong with you yeah this is but

2721
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,280
legitimately like you've been medicated

2723
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,280
they've they've

2725
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,200
put you away right they've brought to

2727
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:37,760
you how did that happen

2729
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,760
well i'll say these two things i think

2731
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,280
uh very three-dimensionally i don't

2733
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,520
think

2735
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,400
in the black and white lines that i've

2737
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,800
been programmed

2739
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,520
to think in and i and i think in full

2741
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,559
color

2743
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,680
so when i talk i have to describe

2745
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:56,880
a thought in five ways

2747
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,280
you know we we enjoy food that has

2749
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,040
multiple seasoning in it we enjoy music

2751
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,160
that has multiple instruments

2753
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,200
so when i talk it's not a rant

2755
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,040
it's a symphony of ideas and

2757
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,640
when you collect them you say oh these

2759
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,680
are all these things that connect

2761
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,760
yeah you know i i

2763
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,720
i just tell the truth and telling the

2765
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,400
truth

2767
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,000
is crazy in a world full of lies

2769
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,839
that's simply it but none of the things

2771
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,280
you're saying are crazy another things

2773
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,839
you said are crazy

2775
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,319
it's fascinating the way you think

2777
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,000
because

2779
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,200
i can see that you're thinking in all

2781
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,480
these different layers and you're

2783
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,680
looking at things from all these

2785
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,119
different perspectives

2787
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,839
and they all come together out of your

2789
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,359
mouth in like a tornado of ideas

2791
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:41,119
now if someone wants to just have a

2793
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,319
conversation with you back and forth i

2795
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,319
could see whether you go this guy's

2797
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:46,480
crazy just doesn't stop he's ranting

2799
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,319
but what i'm seeing is just you're a

2801
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,520
very thorough thinker

2803
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:53,440
you're thinking at things independently

2805
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,119
but you're thinking of things in a

2807
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,520
massive perspective

2809
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,559
now who convinced you that that's bad is

2811
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,680
it have you

2813
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:04,000
always been this way or were you

2815
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,160
less is it was it less manageable before

2817
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,839
did you have issues with it before

2819
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:13,839
yeah i believe before i

2821
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:15,760
found christ and gave my life to god

2823
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,440
i would try to lean on my own

2825
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,720
understanding and that's

2827
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,280
the universe is

2829
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,960
like a black hole of information what do

2831
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,920
you mean by your own understanding

2833
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,359
meaning when people ask einstein said

2835
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,640
you're the smartest person what would

2837
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,280
you like to know

2839
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,440
he his einstein's response was i'd like

2841
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,880
to understand the mind of god

2843
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,119
meaning meaning god is all-knowing and

2845
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,920
we can only know or see and for me as a

2847
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,880
visionary

2849
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,240
we can only know or see what god allows

2851
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,359
us to see and what he

2853
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:52,880
feels we're ready to see and understand

2855
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:55,119
to to maximize what our mass laws

2857
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,720
hierarchy and e chart is you know what

2859
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,760
sets our dopa means what sets our

2861
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,079
serotonins off

2863
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,480
what makes us feel good basically like

2865
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,480
you know we we did a good deed

2867
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,839
and it's like it was somehow where you

2869
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,440
know you know just doing a beat

2871
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,839
for a famous per or just doing a beat

2873
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,880
for

2875
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:15,040
um a local dope rapper

2877
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,920
really meant a lot to me when i was 14

2879
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,640
years old

2881
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,599
doing a beat for just anyone famous that

2883
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,800
had a major

2885
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:25,760
record deal was a lot to me at age 19.

2887
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,800
me being able to you know put out my own

2889
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,000
music and put my

2891
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:33,200
own i was a lot to me at age 24 meaning

2893
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,760
as i grow god sets

2895
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,800
new stages in the game of life for me

2897
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,200
that you get your

2899
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,000
satisfaction like maslow's hierarchy of

2901
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,319
need is like

2903
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,599
our satisfaction chart what makes us

2905
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:46,720
feel whole

2907
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,800
and uh accomplished as a as a

2909
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,960
as a human being so as i go through

2911
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,920
these different levels there's times

2913
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,319
where

2915
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,119
i would use confidence when i knew what

2917
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,280
i was doing

2919
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,880
and i would use arrogance when i didn't

2921
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,000
know what i was doing but i'd rather use

2923
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:05,200
arrogance than to let someone

2925
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,200
diminish my idea of myself because that

2927
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,480
is what keeps us going hope actually

2929
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,160
keeps us alive

2931
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,079
anybody you ask most people is like do

2933
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,480
you want tomorrow to come and they say

2935
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,599
yes they have they have hope for it but

2937
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,079
i went from having

2939
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,800
confidence and arrogance to having faith

2941
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,440
and faith

2943
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,240
is the opposite of fear and that created

2945
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,800
this

2947

fearless approach that i have and that's

2949
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,960
what

2951
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:31,760
made now has made me the fearless leader

2953
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,640
that i am that i've like crystallized

2955
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,920
into

2957
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,720
the leader that my mom always knew i

2959
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,280
would be

2961
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,000
when kids followed me in preschool the

2963
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,319
leader

2965
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,839
that people saw when we changed the

2967
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:46,960
sound of music the leader

2969
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:48,160
when we changed uh the the sneaker

2971
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,160
industry the leader

2973
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,160
and what we're doing with uh with

2975
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,680
farming and with with shelters

2977
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,280
when i was building you know the

2979
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,319
homeless shelters uh

2981
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,480
a couple years ago and visiting parks

2983
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:03,760
and and then going to skip row and

2985
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:06,240
understanding the uh uh the

2987
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,040
dynamics and empathizing with what

2989
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,559
actual

2991
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:13,839
mental health issues are not someone

2993
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,640
you know telling their truth or being

2995
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:17,760
exhausted

2997
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,079
and then being labeled as such like

2999
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,040
i am so that's what you felt happened to

3001
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,720
you like you were

3003
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,400
absolutely truth and you were exhausted

3005
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,440
and they labeled you as mentally

3007
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,280
unhealthy

3009
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,720
yes absolutely am i saying this right

3011
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,000
that what happened with you

3013
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:34,800
is you feel like maybe

3015
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,280
or you probably feel like that having

3017
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,680
this

3019
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,359
higher calling and recognizing this

3021
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,559
higher power

3023
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:45,040
was the the glue that kept your thoughts

3025
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:48,880
together they kept your mind straight

3027
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:51,440
and it kept you on a righteous path

3029
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,520
so instead of being scattered with all

3031
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,000
these crazy thoughts and being exhausted

3033
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,880
and

3035
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,440
being labeled manic right like we talked

3037
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,960
before

3039
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,480
and you were saying that they had you on

3041
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,000
medication but the medication [ __ ]

3043
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,400
with your creativity

3045
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,480
it [ __ ] with all kinds of things or it

3047
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,040
blocked my ability to channel

3049
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,720
what god wanted me to do but we're all

3051
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,359
we're all on medication right now did

3053
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,200
you use

3055
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:15,119
toothpaste with fluoride today it blocks

3057
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,599
your pineal gland and they put

3059
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,280
children on it and we put we put our

3061
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,520
kids on it you know we

3063
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,359
it's inside the the deodorants that we

3065
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,720
use is all these things to

3067
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,040
create like a disconnect to god to serve

3069
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,000
that

3071
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,960
it's like are you serving man are you

3073
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,960
serving

3075
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,000
the the one and only master but what did

3077
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,680
they tell you

3079
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,119
when when they said that they were going

3081
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,000
to put you on medication what do they

3083
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,599
put you on

3085
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,960
and what did they tell you one of my

3087
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,799
favorite things that they did is they

3089
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,839
put me on this medication

3091
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:47,520
that made me uh gain a lot of weight and

3093
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,280
i said i'm not gonna take this

3095
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,200
and they said okay we got a medication

3097
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,119
you could take but you won't gain weight

3099
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,040
and this shows you they were trying to

3101
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:58,559
kill a superhero

3103
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:00,960
slowly trying to kill genius trying to

3105
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:03,599
make me not feel like i could run for

3107
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:06,640
president make me not feel like i can go

3109
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,000
uh be born in atlanta grow up on the

3111
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,640
south side of chicago

3113
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,520
go into music go and win all these

3115
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,440
grammys

3117
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,200
change the sound of music and the look

3119
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,640
of stage performances

3121
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,160
all that and then still end up in 53

3123
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,839
million dollars in debt what music

3125
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,760
industry has people going to the exact

3127
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,040
debt of the house that they think

3129
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,680
they're gonna buy

3131
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,520
after the tour is over and it's and it's

3133
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,799
it's strategized there's criminals

3135
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,960
all over everyone's almost

3137
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,319
accounts in the music industry it's not

3139
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,319
a safe place it's a

3141
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:40,000
it's a treacherous place so filled with

3143
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,040
money soon as things are filled with

3145
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,400
money they're filled with people that

3147
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,799
are trying to take advantage of other

3149
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,079
people

3151
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,799
it's filled with money bees come to

3153
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,760
honey exactly exactly

3155
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:51,280
so they put they put you on this ship

3157
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,839
because you were exhausted

3159
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,839
what did they put you on um

3161
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:03,119
um you know i'm i can i can research

3163
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,920
i'm actually forgetting the exact

3165
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,119
medication

3167
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,440
that they had um but what did it do uh

3169
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:12,480
you

3171
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,480
the main thing that it did is

3173
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:20,799
it destroyed my confidence it made me

3175
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:24,480
this shell of who i really am

3177
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:27,520
it like grayed over my eyes

3179
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,079
it it it made me

3181
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,400
it made the mustang that buck anymore

3183
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:36,079
hmm

3185
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,880
they sedated you yes yeah and

3187
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,880
they what was the the thought process

3189
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,760
behind it when you talked to a doctor

3191
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,200
about this

3193
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,040
what did they tell you was wrong with

3195
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:48,720
you

3197
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:52,079
uh they they told me i was bipolar

3199
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,799
and i remember going on tmz and saying

3201
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,760
you know slavery is a choice and they

3203
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:58,640
medicated

3205
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,359
me for saying that for having that

3207
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,319
opinion

3209
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:04,400
and saying it out loud but as i put

3211
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:08,720
those contracts up i'm saying

3213
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:10,960
this is a choice as i you know

3215
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,880
you didn't mean people being abducted

3217
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,200
and brought into slavery and

3219
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,559
put into chains was a choice what you

3221
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,400
were talking about is

3223
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,000
people making decisions that would

3225
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,240
enslave them financially

3227
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,680
and enslave their life yeah it was taken

3229
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,799
out of context

3231
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,359
and it was taken in the least charitable

3233
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,839
way

3235
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,440
and they decided to try to say look at

3237
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,240
crazy kanye look at this [ __ ] he's

3239
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,280
saying

3241
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,680
and then they medicate you yes

3243
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,799
and the media has always taken anything

3245
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:44,000
out of context that isn't a part of

3247
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:47,040
the overall narrative yeah that

3249
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,839
because there's you know like hollywood

3251
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,079
and media

3253
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,760
has controlled so much of the narrative

3255
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,839
and then

3257
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,880
he had silicon valley and that's what's

3259
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:56,559
so beautiful about

3261
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,000
one of my heroes steve jobs because

3263
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,160
there wouldn't be

3265
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,040
a silicon valley or the silicon valley

3267
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,240
wouldn't be

3269
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,599
what it is today if steve jobs didn't

3271
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,400
make

3273
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,680
information accessible like this which

3275
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,960
is still

3277
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:16,880
a bit controlled but it feels like

3279
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:20,400
twitter is the

3281
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:24,400
the safest fleet freest uh

3283
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:26,559
mass platform to communicate on

3285
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,040
and you know it's like they mess with

3287
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,960
jack because of that you know you know

3289
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,400
well it's it's still censored there's a

3291
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,839
lot of issues now but i think that's

3293
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,680
internal i think that's people that are

3295
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:38,000
working there that are woke that want to

3297
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,920
stop people from saying certain things

3299
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,319
and there's a lot of struggles with that

3301
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,680
today

3303
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:44,799
and i it's unfortunate because i i do

3305
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,200
agree that it's an

3307
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,079
unbelievable way to get ideas out there

3309
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,720
yeah so

3311
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,720
but it's also it's a new thing and it's

3313
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,359
mismanaged by the people that use it

3315
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,480
often

3317
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,640
they don't know what they're doing or

3319
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,319
why they're doing it every version of

3321
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,960
anything that man

3323
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:03,040
has made will be flawed sure and it has

3325
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,359
to go through a bunch of different

3327
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,880
steps of evolution it has to it has to

3329
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:09,760
evolve and change

3331
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,680
so why did you agree to let them do this

3333
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,240
to you why did you agree to let them

3335
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,240
medicate you

3337
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,520
because if that is that look i'm crazy

3339
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,799
for sure

3341
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,520
but if someone came to me and go hey

3343
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,960
we're going to put you on some

3345
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,079
medication that medication is going to

3347
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,079
calm you down i'd be like

3349
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,200
everything i do is because i'm not calm

3351
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,319
everything that i've ever done that's

3353
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,240
made me successful

3355
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:36,880
is because i have more energy it's

3357
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,559
because i i have a wildness

3359
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,079
like i'm not calming that down like i

3361
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,760
know how to calm myself down

3363
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,200
i can self-medicate with exercise and

3365
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,400
meditation and

3367
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,400
marijuana and a bunch of different

3369
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,799
things but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna

3371
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:52,160
take some medication that removes

3373
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:54,160
anything that's unique with you

3375
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,680
and all these wild ideas that come to

3377
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,040
your head like very few people could

3379
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,440
string together these thoughts the way

3381
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,440
you're

3383
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,960
describing them today if somebody asked

3385
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,119
me if there's anything wrong with him

3387
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,559
he's [ __ ] he's filled with awesome

3389
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,480
like what's what's wrong with that if

3391
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,319
you can keep that together what you just

3393
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,480
did the way you just described

3395
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,760
reimagining civilization reimagining

3397
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,000
church reimagining

3399
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,880
the food supplies there's nothing bad

3401
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,960
about that

3403
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,760
this is all very interesting and very

3405
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:22,160
good like i would never say that's bad

3407
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,799
but are you this way all the time or is

3409
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,280
there good

3411
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:26,559
versions of kanye and versions of kanye

3413
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,359
where you don't feel like you have a

3415
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,920
grip on

3417
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,640
these thoughts you know what i love is

3419
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:35,280
there was

3421
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:39,760
uh some perspectives that people

3423
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:42,000
showed about what a true

3425
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,599
manic episode really looks like after i

3427
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,119
was in south carolina

3429
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:50,480
and this one guy was talking about his

3431
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:51,839
mom being in an episode and kidnapping

3433
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,280
his brother

3435
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:58,880
and you know like proper extreme

3437
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:02,400
cases you know i

3439
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:05,680
cried and was gut

3441
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:08,400
wrenched like at the

3443
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,720
i don't even like to say out loud what i

3445
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,520
s

3447
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,319
what i said on south carolina but the

3449
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,599
idea

3451
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:17,680
of you know i'm just

3453
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,680
trying to word it in a way that's really

3455
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,000
safe and covers my family

3457
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,000
um

3459
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,799
people saw this clip of me crying some

3461
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,599
people didn't know

3463
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:31,760
what i was crying about but i was crying

3465
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:35,280
about

3467
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,799
that there was a a possible chance

3469
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,799
you know i'm just i'm looking at a way

3471
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:42,960
to say this

3473
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:42,960
that there was a chance that

3475
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,760
you know that we didn't make that kim

3477
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,799
and i didn't make the family we have

3479
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,640
today

3481
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:54,960
that's much that's my most like uh

3483
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,680
family friendly you know way to word

3485
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,039
that

3487
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:01,920
and just the idea of it just tears me up

3489
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:05,280
inside that i was a part of a culture

3491
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:08,880
that promotes this kind of thing like

3493
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:12,720
one of the uh major statistics

3495
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:16,319
on the subject of life is

3497
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:20,240
um that the greatest

3499
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:23,839
advocates for um

3501
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:27,920
the a the a word is

3503
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:31,359
are men from ages 31 to 37

3505
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:34,480
and that's how old i was and

3507
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:35,280
i felt like i was too busy my dad felt

3509
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,799
like

3511
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:42,240
he was too busy for me and

3513
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:46,160
we have a culture of that and

3515
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,160
they have a child rebel soldiers

3517
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,400
that were in africa that would be doped

3519
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,680
up

3521
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,640
and psyched out and made to kill their

3523
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,359
parents

3525
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,559
were well in our culture we're doped up

3527
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:01,760
and psyched out

3529
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:04,960
and made to kill our children you know

3531
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:08,960
we have to decouple the conversation of

3533
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:11,920
uh planned parenthood and

3535
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,359
woman's choice now so of course i'm

3537
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,720
christian so i'm

3539
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:21,200
pro-life um

3541
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:23,839
and when i go into office i'm not

3543
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,240
changing laws because i realize we live

3545
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:27,119
in an

3547
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:29,440
imperfect world in an imperfect society

3549
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:31,039
what i will be presenting is a plan a

3551
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,720
and we've already started to work on

3553
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,799
plan a to change the

3555
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,319
connotation of orphanages to change the

3557
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:38,720
connotation of foster care

3559
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:39,920
and not just change the connotation you

3561
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,720
know verbally

3563
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,119
but to create places that are to the

3565
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:47,039
level of like the amman geary and disney

3567
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,960
world how to had a kid

3569
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:50,480
you know what is this like and we have

3571
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,799
so much land

3573
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,680
that this can be created and then spread

3575
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:57,119
across

3577
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:58,559
the world to orphanages in africa and in

3579
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,599
china and just

3581
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:04,319
um uh across the globe to

3583
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:06,559
to create these environments that when

3585
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,280
there's expecting families moms and

3587
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,839
fathers

3589
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,559
that they feel like there's a place even

3591
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,039
if

3593
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,480
they don't feel well off enough to bring

3595
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,440
another life into this world that

3597
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:20,880
there's a place to go there's a plan a

3599
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,839
because plan b and planned parenthood

3601
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,960
were planned

3603
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:28,079
by a eugenics that set out and said

3605
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,799
out loud i'm doing this to

3607
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,400
kill the black race and to create

3609
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:35,599
population control

3611
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:38,839
you know if we what are you saying plan

3613
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:41,520
b mean the pill meaning the

3615
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:43,440
the morning-after pill you know what let

3617
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,960
me planned parenthood let me let me let

3619
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,720
me decouple those things let me

3621
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,799
let me talk about planned parenthood

3623
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,599
okay

3625
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,880
there's the last figure i saw is there

3627
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:56,319
were 210

3629
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:59,599
000 deaths due to covet

3631
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:02,960
in america and everywhere you go you see

3633
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:02,960
someone with a mask on

3635
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:10,400
with a the a word

3637
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:13,280
a culture i'll say it one time with

3639
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:16,559
abortion culture

3641
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:20,480
there are 1 000

3643
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:25,760
black children aborted

3645
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:29,839
a day daily we are in genocide

3647
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:33,039
we so more black children

3649
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:36,160
have died in the past

3651
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:39,520
since february than people have died

3653
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:42,480
of covet and everyone wears a mask

3655
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:44,000
so it's a matter of where are we turning

3657
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,559
a blind's eye to

3659
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,079
like the media can control a lot of

3661
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,720
times it has to control what we care

3663
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:51,520
about

3665
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,799
i even heard somebody say at one point

3667
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,599
this is the actual sentence i heard

3669
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:57,119
someone say puerto rico so played out

3671
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:59,200
meaning there was a time where people

3673
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,640
were caring about it and now the media

3675
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,599
says don't care about it but these

3677
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,680
people

3679
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,720
it still hasn't been solved the the

3681
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,480
hurricane's still

3683
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,839
hit the earthquakes still hidden people

3685
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,720
are still suffering from that

3687
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:12,240
and no one has really gone to fix it and

3689
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,920
when that 11 billion

3691
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,079
goes to haiti and it doesn't get to the

3693
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:19,839
people

3695
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:23,359
you know the daily mail post a

3697
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:27,119
a swimsuit pick or something and uh

3699
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:29,359
deters our energy to what we have to do

3701
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:32,480
collectively to

3703
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:33,760
to to to help our brothers and sisters

3705
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,880
you know i look at

3707
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:39,359
society as as one body

3709
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,640
i want to just go into this rift because

3711
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,400
my thoughts are like

3713
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,599
these clouds and mario brothers and i'll

3715
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,359
jump to this and i'll see another one

3717
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,160
i'll jump to another and say oh yes i

3719
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:49,839
jump to another

3721
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:53,039
i need to express this uh this story

3723
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:56,319
i believe that you know

3725
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:59,440
love will heal all and

3727
01:06:56,319 --> 01:07:01,119
we have to look at i believe i believe

3729
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,160
that world peace is possible

3731
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:08,960
and i believe it's us looking

3733
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:12,240
at each other as a moment in time

3735
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:13,839
time is love you love the things you put

3737
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:16,400
time into that's where i'm in time is

3739
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:18,160
love like because this is like

3741
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,680
uh this intangible thing this thing you

3743
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,960
can't grab you can't just grab time in

3745
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,079
your hand you can't grab love in your

3747
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,520
hand but

3749
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,480
but we feel both of these things are

3751
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,599
real for us to love one another just as

3753
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,880
simple as that like

3755
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:34,559
love will heal the world this is

3757
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:37,280
what it's gonna take to heal the world

3759
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:38,960
but we have a competitive spirit we like

3761
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,839
having a bad guy we like having a

3763
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,359
competitor

3765
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:44,799
so what we need to do is change the bad

3767
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:48,640
guy change the competitor

3769
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:49,760
make the competitor be the roman era the

3771
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,680
roman civilization

3773
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:57,200
make the uh competitive be the

3775
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:58,240
egyptian kingdom and say we are the

3777
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,359
first society

3779
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:04,559
we're the first civilization that

3781
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:07,920
ever became civil because we are still

3783
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:11,599
just as much in the dark ages

3785
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:14,720
as medieval times or as game of thrones

3787
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:17,359
you know level uh black mirror

3789
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,799
level i i know i went past future other

3791
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,799
dimension for a second

3793
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:22,400
but we kill each other we kill each

3795
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:24,799
other on

3797
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,679
social media we kill each other in high

3799
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,520
schools

3801
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,880
like in the way with that we talk to

3803
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,040
each other we

3805
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,239
we physically kill each other in our own

3807
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,440
neighborhoods and

3809
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:36,080
outside of neighborhoods you know this

3811
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,480
planet

3813
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,120
when we when we keep turning a blind's

3815
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,120
eye

3817
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:44,000
to our brothers and our sisters and our

3819
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:47,040
family which is

3821
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,799
us as a whole as all of humanity then

3823
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,080
of course it's going to get to the point

3825
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:54,400
where

3827
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:57,839
there's you know homeless sleeping under

3829
01:08:54,400 --> 01:09:00,400
you know a um a bridge in calabasas

3831
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:02,960
because we ignored the homeless person

3833
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:05,600
sleeping in front of the gucci store

3835
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,159
how do you how does just look at that

3837
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,040
visual

3839
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:10,480
it's a homeless person sleeping in front

3841
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,839
of the gucci store

3843
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,880
we have builders we have people who know

3845
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,480
how to make

3847
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,480
communities we have people who know how

3849
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:22,560
to cook and how to make food

3851
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:24,560
and how to um

3853
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,319
how to bring this food people are

3855
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,040
fighting over land and not really

3857
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,000
realizing

3859
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:32,400
that we're not uh we're not maximizing

3861
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,600
our resources and our existence

3863
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:38,799
we've got genius level

3865
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:41,120
scientists we've got people who rogue uh

3867
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:43,199
you know people who have uh broken out

3869
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,319
of the chains like elon like imagine if

3871
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:46,880
elon was

3873
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,600
working at gm on the third floor

3875
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,400
somewhere

3877
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,600
you know we wouldn't have electric cars

3879
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:54,560
we wouldn't have

3881
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,679
that new porsche hybrid we wouldn't have

3883
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,480
uh

3885
01:09:55,679 --> 01:10:00,640
uh what what's happening with you know

3887
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:04,000
hyperloop imagine if

3889
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:06,560
the guy that uh you know started airbnb

3891
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,440
uh uh was shut down or the guys who

3893
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,600
started uber

3895
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,719
were shut down all of these people who

3897
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,520
break away

3899
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:15,280
and then create the new society and the

3901
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,400
next frontier where we're going people

3903
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:19,840
like i've said

3905
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:23,199
like it feels to me like mit is a place

3907
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,640
that has to be funded by people who want

3909
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,520
to take the smartest people on the

3911
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,280
planet

3913
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,000
and make them work on the smallest

3915
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:32,159
things that won't change

3917
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,120
anything and i've talked to people from

3919
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:35,120
mit and i could

3921
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,440
look at these brill like this brilliant

3923
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:40,000
person i was talking from mit

3925
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,360
and he was he was afraid everything was

3927
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
fear everything was about

3929
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:45,600
his his girlfriend's pregnant and you

3931
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,360
know we just got a house

3933
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,440
and i don't want to do anything to

3935
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:51,520
change this and i and this is like

3937
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,120
one of the most brilliant people on the

3939
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,840
planet but if you mix

3941
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:58,159
brilliance with bravery that we can

3943
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,199
ignite something even this conversation

3945
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:02,880
alone can ignite the people that are

3947
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:04,400
going to change the world because

3949
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,159
there's people who have been anointed

3951
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,679
you can't teach

3953
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:10,239
the brilliance and the anointings

3955
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,080
there's people who hit the game of life

3957
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:13,600
and they've got something that they're

3959
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,560
going to do no matter what school they

3961
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,400
go to

3963
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,840
they know they just know how to do it

3965
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,400
they knew how to do it before they got

3967
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,440
here

3969
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,560
and they were going to do it and these

3971
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:27,199
people just need to

3973
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:31,679
see what it looks like to overcome

3975
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:35,040
the smoke screens of public humiliation

3977
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:38,239
of bankruptcy i was in debt

3979
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,679
uh the fear loss i lost my mom or the

3981
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:42,640
fear of death

3983
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:44,000
you know what other fears uh are there

3985
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,679
there's a lot of fears but

3987
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,280
the thing is when you remove like even

3989
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:49,280
in the schools you remove prayer you

3991
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:51,040
remove god you remove

3993
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,560
the fear of god you create the

3995
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:56,239
possibility of the fear

3997
01:11:52,560 --> 01:12:00,880
of everything else but watch this

3999
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:06,080
if you instill the fear of god

4001
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:10,080
you eliminate the fear of anything else

4003
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:14,080
and it's not that i am

4005
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:14,080
fearless i am

4007
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:22,320
definitely literally definitely shaking

4009
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:28,320
and in so much fear of my father

4011
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:28,320
i fear god and i don't fear nothing else

4013
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,960
there's some power to that right like it

4015
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,640
just has a mental management tool

4017
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,080
there's some real power to that because

4019
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:39,600
so many people are afraid

4021
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:41,360
of every single little aspect of life

4023
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,520
bills and debt and love and

4025
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,239
relationships and if you have a higher

4027
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,600
power

4029
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:47,120
and this is one of the things that i've

4031
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,880
always wanted to make what's the main

4033
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,800
word that you use even for fear this is

4035
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,679
the main disease

4037
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,239
that that people use in politics it's

4039
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,800
the main

4041
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:57,520
fear is it but it's a main word it's the

4043
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,239
disease

4045
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,719
attacking the world because it it it

4047
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:06,159
destroys your it changes your posture

4049
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:08,320

4051
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:09,520
worry yeah anxiety that's right that's

4053
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,840
what it is stress

4055
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,440
like it can kill you you can't be free

4057
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,320
you can't be free to take chances

4059
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,800
to be worried about stuff like an honest

4061
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,040
yeah

4063
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,159
so to be able to anchor and eliminate

4065
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:23,120
worry

4067
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:24,239
and say this i am walking in a righteous

4069
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,239
path

4071
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:27,280
and i don't have to worry about anything

4073
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,640
i don't have to worry about going to

4075
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,760
jail i have to worry about being killed

4077
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,880
i don't have to worry about bankruptcy i

4079
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,880
don't have to worry about

4081
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:36,080
um you know uh humiliation

4083
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,080
you know because this comes this is

4085
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,760
where smart alec prayers can get you

4087
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:43,120
i used to have this really smart outlet

4089
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:46,640

and then he took my mom

4095
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:58,960
so it's hard to hurt that much

4097
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:00,960
ever again and create it

4099
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,320
almost like a character like deadpool

are

4161
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,960
worse than the corporate made disney

4191
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,000
my

4193
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,960

4195
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,159
like forget

4197
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:41,600
no man this is george this is his baby

us his children the hero's journey you

4203
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:48,000
know

4205
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,600
and these these like how can we running

4207
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,520
back and replay like even

4209
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,760
at disney you know there's there's

4211
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,840
people you know at a

4213
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,040
pixar that have left people have left

4215
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:00,560
you know where

4217
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:02,159
um uh they call

4219
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,000
i've forgot the exact title but saying

4221
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:05,840
like every time is a new idea

4223
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,679
they call it like an unproven idea so

4225
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:11,440
they'll get to toy story

4227
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:14,800
800 000 and frozen trillion

4229
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:16,880
before there's a new concept uh

4231
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,239
to take a chance on yeah to take a

4233
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,199
chance yeah and we've been we've been

4235
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:21,360
programmed like

4237
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,199
when you see the you know the homes the

4239
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:26,960
style of homes that i've been developing

4241
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:30,080
they're far closer to the way the galaxy

4243
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:31,600
looks the way water looks the way our

4245
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:34,239
makeup in our body

4247
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,000
feels uh we've been uh we've been put

4249
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:37,679
into these boxes and that was you know

4251
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,800
due to money they do the construction

4253
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:42,000
that we have to be in these

4255
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,480
these boxes and we've been stuck in a

4257
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,480
loop

4259
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,080
like on uh westworld and something i

4261
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,640
feel like tandy newton on westworld

4263
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,800
where

4265
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,080
she had to use the people that enslaved

4267
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,120
her that trapped her

4269
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:56,560
to make it to make it out you know the

4271
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:58,159
uh and it's funny when i

4273
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,080
like the box and when i'm talking about

4275
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:01,199
farming i had a point about farming that

4277
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,760
i didn't finish earlier

4279
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:05,199
i hired this guy to do the a to z

4281
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,880
concept i made it plain as day

4283
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:08,320
make it so everything we cook in the

4285
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,880
kitchen at the school

4287
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,360
we plant it here and they would just do

4289
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,480
it

4291
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:16,560
to 70 percent they'd do it to

4293
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,080
60 percent earlier when i had that point

4295
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,520
i went to this whole riff about

4297
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,280
children needing to learn physics and

4299
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,880
children needing to learn how to really

4301
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,520
do things and not having this separated

4303
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:28,000
thing

4305
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:30,480
like we are programmed to

4307
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,199
lock ourselves in a box and what's

4309
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:35,280
amazing right now is

4311
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:37,120
the opportunity and the platform that we

4313
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:40,880
have that the world is hurting

4315
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:43,120
for everyone for those that are in power

4317
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,000
for those that are inside the program

4319
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:47,120
even those that are

4321
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,640
in power are still a part of

4323
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:52,800
the program and you know i

4325
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,800
read this uh this tweet that someone

4327
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:58,239
said i finished watching

4329
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:01,920
netflix what's next and

4331
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:01,920
that's so true that

4333
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,920
we can't even program enough to satisfy

4335
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,840
ourselves

4337
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,440
the program is done forrest gump has

4339
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,080
stopped running and just

4341
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,760
turned around it's like all of this

4343
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:16,320
thing is a setup the

4345
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,440
the the the concerts that musicians go

4347
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,040
to where we don't

4349
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,400
you know we're not thinking about the

4351
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,679
fact that we're not getting the lion's

4353
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,199
share of our masters because we're

4355
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:23,760
making the money on tour and then tour

4357
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:29,199
has

4359
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:29,199
girls and tour has the the the the arena

4361
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,840
singing your song and i need you right

4363
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,640
now

4365
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:38,840
did you do good champ you know like uh

4367
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:42,480
with floyd mayweather

4369
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:45,120
um is is such a hero of mine and so

4371
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,760
excellent because he is a a champion

4373
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:49,520
right

4375
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:53,040
but then also he wasn't afraid to say

4377
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:54,159
i do my deals i make my money and what i

4379
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:57,600
like is

4381
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:58,159
you know he didn't let the the older

4383
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,159
system

4385
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:01,280
tell him how to spend his money or how

4387
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:03,360
to show his money

4389
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,880
it was up to him because he's the he's

4391
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,040
his own king

4393
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,719
you know god is the king of us all but

4395
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,719
he's his own king

4397
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,760
and a lot of times in america we haven't

4399
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:13,600
seen

4401
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,960
we haven't seen kings we haven't seen

4403
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:18,000
the the the

4405
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:19,760
the royal blood in our bone marrow

4407
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,040
and the way it comes through now we can

4409
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,159
show it

4411
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:25,760
in and rap and the way we put our chains

4413
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,120
on the way we dress we can show them the

4415
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,760
way we play ball and things like that

4417
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:31,520
but it's

4419
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:33,120
another frontier to being

4421
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,440
to being a king well there's also

4423
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:37,520
something where you feel diminished

4425
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,760
in the fact that you know that your

4427
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,679
money is being stolen

4429
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,840
by people that don't deserve it so if

4431
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:45,120
you have some record executives if you

4433
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,960
have some people that you know

4435
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:48,320
have looped you into a [ __ ] up deal

4437
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,679
and they're making millions while you're

4439
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:52,560
making thousands

4441
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,880
that [ __ ] with your head yeah it just

4443
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,159
does

4445
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,159
it makes you worry makes you stress

4447
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:57,520
gives you exactly anxiety did he touch

4449
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,480
you it could drive you crazy yeah it

4451
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,360
could drive you crazy

4453
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:03,280
yeah yeah so i still don't understand

4455
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,800
how they talked you into medication man

4457
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,800
i wish i knew you better

4459
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,159
back then because uh i would have just

4461
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,239
had you exercise

4463
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:12,239
i would idea i would say so what

4465
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:14,480
whatever he's doing

4467
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:15,520
you can't do like you have to understand

4469
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:18,080
that

4471
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,880
different people have different amounts

4473
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:22,000
of energy

4475
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:24,560
they have you you have this ability

4477
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,320
to to have these like really

4479
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:27,120
all-encompassing thoughts where you have

4481
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:30,560
these

4483
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:32,239
long trains of ideas and thoughts in

4485
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,960
your head and you're implementing them

4487
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:36,080
this is all good this is this is a

4489
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,600
powerful thing

4491
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,000
i don't think it's a negative thing at

4493
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,679
all i mean some of it comes to

4495
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,199
you know i'm dealing with issues that

4497
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:46,880
are not

4499
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:47,679
just you know black and racial issues

4501
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,440
i'm dealing with

4503
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:54,159
uh maverick you know innovator issues

4505
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:55,360
yeah i'm dealing with you know just as

4507
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:58,080
many

4509
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,639
uh you know issues where there's walls

4511
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,480
of

4513
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:01,840
you know invisible walls and invisible

4515
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,760
chains as

4517
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,880
you know michael jackson dealt with as a

4519
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,080
black musician or

4521
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:09,679
urban musician where he had to go and um

4523
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,360
urban he came with thriller he's like

4525
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:12,800
let me go get this person who directed

4527
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:15,199
which is the eastwick

4529
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,000
to i'm gonna get a movie director and he

4531
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:18,480
changed

4533
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,760
you know uh movies forever i'm dealing

4535
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,560
with some um

4537
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,239
some walls that you know people have

4539
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,679
done to hold back

4541
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:28,080
uh agents of change throughout history

4543
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:30,560
you know

4545
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,199
it's like the movie is here like this

4547
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,520
part

4549
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:35,520
you know us talking right now may be a

4551
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:39,040
scene from my life's movie

4553
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:42,080
uh like tesla was

4555
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:44,320
you know a a white guy that

4557
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,199
was a ladies man and he would be going

4559
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,199
to all the like

4561
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:48,960
fancy events and everything and like he

4563
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:51,360
stopped having sex at age

4565
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,880
40. yeah and said you know i'm going to

4567
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,320
focus on it and

4569
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:58,400
and i mean he died he died penniless

4571
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,920
at the end you know i'm not gonna say

4573
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,960
like he turned evil but he's trying to

4575
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:04,560
sell a bomb

4577
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:07,840
and he had all these like answers

4579
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:09,840
uh that would change the construct of

4581
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,280
society and like my best example is like

4583
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,719
kodak

4585
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,560
is there in a place where they can

4587
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:15,360
barely pull it together now but they

4589
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,760
invented

4591
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:19,360
the digital camera and they didn't bring

4593
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:22,840
it to market

4595
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:26,080
because um because

4597
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:27,679
um they had all this film to sell

4599
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:30,480
well one of the things that's really you

4601
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:34,080
know that's a challenge for me is

4603
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:36,400
you know i've i designed

4605
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:39,040
this thing this we call it the foam

4607
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:42,000
runner and we built a factory for it

4609
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,719
and cody and you can make these uh in 25

4611
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,080
minutes

4613
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:46,239
and what i'm saying about design i was

4615
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:48,320
talking to one of the

4617
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:52,239
just awesome designers that we just uh

4619
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:54,560
uh got over yeezy we got like this

4621
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:56,400
amazing crew we got guys that nike sued

4623
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,080
us for and one of these guys i was

4625
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:00,000
trying to hire him for two years

4627
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,280
he had to he had an encounter he had to

4629
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,600
go surf

4631
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,560
for a year and now he's in and when he

4633
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,239
like

4635
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:09,840
you know does is um is a cad drawings

4637
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:11,120
it's almost like one shot one kill you

4639
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,000
know sometimes you design stuff you got

4641
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,159
to do it like

4643
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,520
five eight times like his first one is

4645
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,960
so close

4647
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,639
to being ready to go to market because

4649
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:21,040
he sketches in a certain kind of way

4651
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:22,560
and for the longest we said you know

4653
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,159
let's um

4655
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,159
uh i've been saying i want to get rid of

4657
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:28,080
laces and

4659
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:30,480
we still have shoes we sell with laces

4661
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:33,199
because it's a popular shoe and people

4663
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:35,280
love this shoe and it it hurts me i feel

4665
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:37,280
like steve jobs trying to like remove

4667
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,480
buttons off the side of the next

4669
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,159
apple and one of the things that's

4671
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,679
interesting about this if you look at

4673
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:42,639
most sneakers if you look at you guys

4675
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:44,800
sneakers right now

4677
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,320
you have a tongue you know and it it

4679
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,320
goes this direction

4681
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,679
this is one of the innovations about

4683
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,400
this is one reason why this is one of

4685
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,440
the most

4687
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:55,520
important sneaker designs is this goes

4689
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:58,719
this way because it's ergonomic

4691
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,760
and i remember putting it on and being

4693
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:01,679
uncomfortable

4695
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:04,560
with wearing it because i'm so used to

4697
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:06,239
like the way like a jordan or something

4699
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,480
fits with my jeans and i remember

4701
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:10,239
talking to kobe and him talking about

4703
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:12,800
having to make sneakers that fit with

4705
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:14,719
jeans and that was a big thing because

4707
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:17,120
you know that's what we grow up we go

4709
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,320
you know coconut jeans and jordans or

4711
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:22,239
something like that so

4713
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:25,440
um this also i feel that

4715
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:27,600
just the process when i design i become

4717
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:29,760
like a three-year-old i have to go to my

4719
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,639
gut i have to forget everything i know

4721
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:34,320
and really focus in to what i feel like

4723
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:36,159
some straight jedi

4725
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,520
yoda or like you know if i could grab

4727
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:38,480
that water bottle like

4729
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,440
like wouldn't it have been cool if i

4731
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,920
just did it right now i should have had

4733
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:45,120
a magnet on there that you feel like

4735
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:47,679
he'd be like yo this dude's a wizard

4737
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,679
um so

4739
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:53,520
so so for me you know i i'm gonna make

4741
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,639
this shoe

4743
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:58,400
be twenty dollars and you know

4745
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:00,239
money isn't real so that means the world

4747
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:03,360
should be eventually free

4749
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:04,960
so i'm gonna manifest the world being

4751
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:07,280
free my dad

4753
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,719
he lives in a dr and he says you know

4755
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:11,600
anything

4757
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:12,000
that you put in the ground grows so why

4759
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,320
do people

4761
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,080
still go hungry and i like that in

4763
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,679
theory but i was like man farming is

4765
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,440
really hard though man i think

4767
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:21,120
you know i might go hungry if i have

4769
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:23,679
someone to farm this food

4771
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,159
it's like but you know back in the days

4773
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:26,320
we

4775
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:28,080
we had that skill set now we're losing

4777
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,440
these skill sets that actually we can

4779
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:32,560
sustain off of

4781
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:34,719
uh so with this uh and i

4783
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,000
i love giving you guys my riffs i'm like

4785
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:38,560
a human version

4787
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,280
of instagram when you look at instagram

4789
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,199
you look at

4791
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:43,120
you know you're looking like a hundred

4793
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:46,400
images a day

4795
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:50,000
uh well i've got millions of images

4797
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:53,040
in my mind and the majority of them

4799
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,520
haven't been realized yet you know

4801
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,600
there's some

4803
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,560
images that are from my memory but i got

4805
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,040
this whole

4807
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,600
the future that's in my mind that has to

4809
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,840
be brought

4811
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,520
so this is you know you talk about hype

4813
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:06,000
culture and shoes being sold

4815
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,800
on the you know the resale market and

4817
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,920
yeezy

4819
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:12,639
lives in that place but i i you know

4821
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,679
i don't like the idea i don't love the

4823
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:15,679
idea

4825
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:17,600
that some of the reason why people buy

4827
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:21,120
it is just

4829
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:22,560
uh for hype culture or

4831
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,920
you ain't got this or i got this

4833
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,960
colorway and you don't have it that type

4835
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,440
of mentality

4837
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:29,040
i mean it's i'm an essentialist i'm a

4839
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:32,800
i'm a minimalist

4841
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:36,480
and like i i i have to i will

4843
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:40,159
bring the the fully a to z

4845
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:41,280
our existence version to existence like

4847
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:44,159
victor gruen

4849
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:46,320
designed the shopping centers but he

4851
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:48,480
designed full utopian communities

4853
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:50,159
and people were like oh we're just cool

4855
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,719
with the shopping center that's all we

4857
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:53,440
want

4859
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:55,120
and these ideas that he had never got

4861
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,360
brought into fruition a little bit like

4863
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,840
disney kind of based epcot center on

4865
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,960
like

4867
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:03,760
on victor gruen but these

4869
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:05,520
this next frontier of these communities

4871
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:08,639
and villages of happiness

4873
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:11,920
are way closer to a kenyan village

4875
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:15,199
than it is to like a gated community uh

4877
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:17,520
village but one of the things about your

4879
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:19,679
this aversion to hype culture one of the

4881
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,920
good things about the hype culture is

4883
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:23,199
if people get into your products they're

4885
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,880
going to get into you and they're going

4887
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:27,520
to get into your ideas

4889
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,199
and all these ideas that you have will

4891
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,639
become a part of their thought process

4893
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:32,880
they'll start thinking about it

4895
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:34,719
they go hey he's got some great points

4897
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,000
if people really get into your [ __ ]

4899
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:37,840
they're also really going to get into

4901
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,040
your ideas i think it's one of the

4903
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,600
things that make people uncomfortable

4905
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,239
about you

4907
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,360
is you have the courage to have all

4909
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:45,520
these bold ideas

4911
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,400
and to implement them and to do all

4913
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,159
these different things

4915
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:50,159
that bothers people and there's a lot of

4917
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:50,800
people that don't have that kind of

4919
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:53,920
courage

4921
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:55,360
and they are straddled down by anxiety

4923
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,360
and they see a guy like you and they

4925
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,880
like try to find flaws

4927
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,560
they try to find things that are wrong

4929
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,000
with it instead of looking at the

4931
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,520
positive aspects of it

4933
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,920
they'll only concentrate on the negative

4935
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,520
aspects of it i don't think i don't see

4937
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:09,440
it that way i've never saw it that way

4939
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:11,120
i look you look at that guy [ __ ] do

4941
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,960
anything there's people like tesla

4943
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:14,320
and there's people who you know there's

4945
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,159
a person who

4947
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:18,000
killed animals with tesla cords to make

4949
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:18,560
people not like tesla yeah the personal

4951
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,480
citizen

4953
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,840
yeah person who made the electric chair

4955
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,679
be made with the tesla courts

4957
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:26,000
for so people wouldn't like tesla tesla

4959
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:26,880
still has inventions that haven't been

4961
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,120
brought

4963
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,880
to our society that would have brought

4965
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,440
more simplicity and happiness to our

4967
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,960
society

4969
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,719
like the westinghouse ability to

4971
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,719
transmit electricity through the air

4973
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:38,080
which is fascinating i don't know if

4975
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,320
that would have worked in today's

4977
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:42,560
world with cell phones and all the

4979
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:45,120
different electronics and even

4981
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:46,320
you know modern air travel i don't know

4983
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:48,080
i don't know what it

4985
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,360
would have worked but things would have

4987
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,760
been different people

4989
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:53,360
are over designing into industries where

4991
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,360
they see they can make some money as

4993
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:59,600
opposed to stepping back and saying

4995
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:03,920
how do we look at the entire earth

4997
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:07,280
as an opportunity to free

4999
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:09,760
everyone and create happiness for

5001
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:11,360
for everyone so like only a b there's

5003
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,880
only a billion people on the internet

5005
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:15,120
you never think about that there's seven

5007
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:17,360
to eight billion people on the on earth

5009
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,480
but then there's only a billion people

5011
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,880
that are influenced

5013
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:22,080
and that are on the internet we feel

5015
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:25,280
like the internet

5017
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:26,159
is everything it's only like 15 you know

5019
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:30,080
16

5021
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:33,440
18 of human beings

5023
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:35,520
but in order to make

5025
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:37,120
for our civilization for us to survive

5027
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,600
we have to make more human beings we

5029
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,679
have

5031
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,520
we have family we have we have to have

5033
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:43,679
food we have to have shelter

5035
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,960
that we don't have to have the internet

5037
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:47,360
we don't have to have

5039
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,639
music we don't have to have you know

5041
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:51,520
that's a conversation

5043
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:53,520
i mean i mean i mean it enhances life

5045
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,520
yeah it enhances the quality of life

5047
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:58,080
is better but look at the music look

5049
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:01,679
look at look at what the information

5051
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:03,280
where we're we're uh we're putting in it

5053
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:06,880
like i feel bad

5055
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:08,239
when i hear uh rap songs i feel bad even

5057
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:10,320
the stuff that

5059
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:12,480
you know i just recently put out i was

5061
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:15,120
like you know how you listen to lames

5063
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,760
they the imitation man like why is

5065
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,920
that's just

5067
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,600
i don't like that message because we're

5069
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,440
all the imitation of our parents and

5071
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:24,159
imitation of this invitation and then

5073
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,880
imitation of adam and eve you know we're

5075
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:28,320
and

5077
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:30,400
we're uh we're all the next versions

5079
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:32,880
there should be the v2 v3 v4

5081
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:34,400
like you know michelangelo and da vinci

5083
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,520
had the same teacher

5085
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:38,800
you know there's times where you know my

5087
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:41,040
like

5089
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:43,040
uh people work with me or just say like

5091
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:45,520
my mentees or whatever will go out

5093
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:47,520
and they'll do something uh that i

5095
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:48,960
wanted to do and then i'm i'm torn

5097
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,679
because as a man

5099
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,480
you know i'm i'm i'm jealous and i'm

5101
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,679
proud

5103
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,440
at the same time and it's like a

5105
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:58,080
father-son relationship because

5107
01:30:55,440 --> 01:31:01,600
sometimes when the when the sun goes out

5109
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:03,760
and is more successful at things

5111
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,199
the father wants to say that's a good

5113
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,480
job but every time the son does

5115
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:08,080
something that's a good job it reminds

5117
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:11,920
the father of his failures

5119
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:14,880
yes so it's just i mean it's a it's a

5121
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:17,199
it's a it's a strong dynamic that that's

5123
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:21,120
where i have to lean on god

5125
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:24,159
to not be like you know this uh

5127
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:27,280
this like uh prick

5129
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:29,600
that's jealous of you know people who

5131
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:31,600
are innovating or taking

5133
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,520
you know the the goal line because we

5135
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,719
got to realize we're in a relay race of

5137
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:37,760
humanity

5139
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:40,000
at a certain point whoever you know what

5141
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:41,760
what what the inventors in the in the

5143
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,800
past did is now handed over to the

5145
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,880
inventors today

5147
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,639
they're handed over to the next vendors

5149
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,719
well the good thing about the walls and

5151
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:52,960
the perception and all that is

5153
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:55,679
this like smaller barrier to entry

5155
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,880
allows there to be you know a walt

5157
01:31:55,679 --> 01:32:00,639
disney

5159
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:02,159
and a steve jobs and a henry ford so

5161
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:04,480
what i'm doing right now

5163
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:05,920
there's a there's a there's a real

5165
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,679
barrier to entry to doing

5167
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,840
constructing homes and communities and

5169
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:11,440
farms like you can't

5171
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,360
you can't just do it like how you can

5173
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,920
just you know

5175
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:17,199
it's hard for someone to go from i'm not

5177
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:19,360
saying it can't happen

5179
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:20,880
i'm just saying that it's difficult for

5181
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,960
someone to go from

5183
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,719
you know programming and putting their

5185
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,880
music out on the internet today

5187
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:29,280
to what it was that michael jackson had

5189
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,920
to do that very entry was so hard for

5191
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,600
him

5193
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,960
that i mean since he this guy was the

5195
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,360
leader of the jackson five when he was

5197
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,840
five

5199
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:37,120
like his entire life led up and this is

5201
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,440
what he focused on

5203
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,239
and it made and it was all focused on

5205
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:43,520
that

5207
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:45,840
so it made the great michael jackson now

5209
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,800
i want to do this comparison of disney

5211
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:51,520
uh steve

5213
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:51,520
and uh uh henry ford and what yeezy is

5215
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:56,000
it's really hard to make houses it's a

5217
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:58,080
it's like a corrupt

5219
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,239
uh industry also you got contra how many

5221
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:02,560
times have you started on a house and uh

5223
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:04,159
contractors like start over charging for

5225
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:06,480
stuff and the budget ends up being

5227
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:07,600
twice the amount and it's twice as long

5229
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,760
look

5231
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,960
if you had a relationship that's why

5233
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:14,080
relationships are

5235
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:16,000
a better currency than uh than um

5237
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,520
than money if you had a relationship

5239
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,840
with the contractors

5241
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,719
if you were part of their family your

5243
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,880
house would be done

5245
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:24,080
quick i feel like it's a practical joke

5247
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:27,280
on rich people

5249
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:30,159
how long houses take to build

5251
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:32,480
i was in the airport and there was a

5253
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:34,639
first class line that was super slow

5255
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:36,000
and there was a coach area with like

5257
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:39,199
eight openings and there was no one

5259
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,719
in it and then i hopped out and this

5261
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:41,840
other gentleman hopped out with me and

5263
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:42,560
went through that line and we went

5265
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,560
through

5267
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:47,120
but the rich people with the hermes

5269
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:50,080
belts didn't want to lose their position

5271
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:51,360
so bad that they would rather wait in

5273
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,880
the first class line

5275
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:55,120
than to have the time back and go

5277
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:57,520
through that now this gentleman

5279
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,639
is a surgeon that works on people's

5281
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:01,520
hearts through their

5283
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:03,600
feet so it's like that kind of engineer

5285
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,560
serger doctor mentality he's like yeah i

5287
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,880
got money because

5289
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,639
this this is what i'm doing but i'm here

5291
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,440
to serve and i have a mentality that i'm

5293
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:12,719
not better

5295
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:14,320
than the person that's in coach which is

5297
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,440
the reason why we were the only two that

5299
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,760
went through

5301
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:19,040
uh that how do you segue off of this

5303
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,000
when i just go into this like how do you

5305
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:23,120
even find

5307
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,679
a question what are you thinking over

5309
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:26,000
there right now

5311
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:26,880
there's no goodness yeah yeah there's no

5313
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,600
reason to

5315
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:31,520
worry about it yeah you you have this

5317
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:34,080

like messaging like let me show you what

5409
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:26,080

of the future look like but we're 20

5417
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:33,280
years past the future

5419
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:34,639
like it's in 2020 like we're supposed to

5421
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,280
be in the future by 2000

5423
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:39,360
so it's my job to pull the future into

5425
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:40,639
now and that's something i struggle with

5427
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,520
when i talk about the different things

5429
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:44,159
that i'm doing

5431
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:46,880
getting into the idea of doing like

5433
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:48,000
content for netflix or content for hulu

5435
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,679
and like

5437
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,760
what that content because i believe

5439
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,480
we're in the movie i believe we're in

5441
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,880
the game

5443
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:56,480
we're in like grand theft auto it's just

5445
01:36:54,880 --> 01:37:00,239
too many things that

5447
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:02,000
align and we're not we can terraform

5449
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:03,679
what we can do is be like if your grand

5451
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,679
theft auto character just started

5453
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:08,560
redesigning the world

5455
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:10,400
himself like painting his own his own

5457
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:13,280
world we have this opportunity

5459
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,920
to make life as fun as these second

5461
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:17,679
lives

5463
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:20,880
but if you look at how politics

5465
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:22,639
just general unhappiness misery control

5467
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:24,880
the speed that contractors go the

5469
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:27,040
farmers that wouldn't finish the farm

5471
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:28,239
the way we are with each other is why

5473
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,840
people feel like look

5475
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:31,520
everyone's going to go into like this

5477
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:34,480
ready player one

5479
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,119
second life and i believe that our first

5481
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:38,400
life

5483
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:41,040
can be just as a imaginative

5485
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:42,560
uh and it will be so that's my and i

5487
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,199
have a bunch of friends that work in the

5489
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,719

industry and i have friends that work in

5493
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:49,600

5509
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:05,119

go on what you feel like working on you

5513
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:09,520

stuff with your kids

5519
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:13,920
and then whatever these ideas you have

5521
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,560
you just

5523
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:17,119
nourish them you just encourage them you

5525
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,119
just

5527
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:20,159
you just feed whatever thoughts are in

5529
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:24,000
your head

5531
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:27,600
well yeah but what i was expressing

5533
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,880
on that on that last um symphony i gave

5535
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:34,639
you was uh

5537
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:36,239
this uh was um that i do have this

5539
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:36,719
challenge that's where i'm designing i'm

5541
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,639
just

5543
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:39,750
i'm actually designing what i'm doing

5545
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:41,520
with my time saying

5547
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:44,239
[Music]

5549
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:45,520
should i be even taking a meeting like

5551
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:46,960
when i take a meeting

5553
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,800
this i know if it's a good or bad

5555
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:50,000
meeting if someone's talking to me and i

5557
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,239
just get sleepy

5559
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,760
i know that that's not what i should do

5561
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:55,760
but if someone's talking i'm

5563
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:58,320
you know energized i like saying the

5565
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:00,159
word energize over the word excited

5567
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:01,440
because this is what they do to this is

5569
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:03,600
what they do to

5571
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:05,199
all of us they get us excited excited

5573
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,639
and anxiety they kind of go together

5575
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:09,840
like someone can say hey i

5577
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:10,400
got you a new car um and it's across the

5579
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,760
street

5581
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,760
you get so excited you run across the

5583
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,320
street get hit by a car trying to run to

5585
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:16,400
your new

5587
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:18,320
but if you're energized about having the

5589
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,480
car perhaps you look both ways see i

5591
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:24,080
played this dictionary game with the

5593
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:25,119
like this uh um this small webster

5595
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:27,199
pocket dictionary

5597
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:28,880
and we'll go to a page and say go to

5599
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:30,480
page with the word help on it

5601
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,920
and we say highlight all the words you

5603
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,960
think are positive and then we talk

5605
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,239
about afterwards

5607
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:36,880
why do you think that's positive so the

5609
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:41,440
word help is like

5611
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:42,080
it's like a uh it's like a bad leg on a

5613
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,440
table

5615
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,800
you think you could stand on it but if

5617
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,520
you stand right there that table could

5619
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,000
flip over

5621
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,040
the fourth definition in the word help

5623
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,719
is

5625
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:54,719
to ignore and it actually makes sense

5627
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:55,840
you know oh like if you have a meeting

5629
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:57,600
right here's the answer when you know

5631
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,440
the meeting didn't go do good

5633
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,960
uh after it didn't go well the person

5635
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,639
says it then oh how can i help that

5637
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,239
means they don't want to do nothing

5639
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:05,679
let me just give you a phone number

5641
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:08,639
right you know the word

5643
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:10,639
is to ensure and then there's a lot of

5645
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:13,920
words that end with ure

5647
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:18,080
that are very powerful future sure

5649
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:19,600
pure endure and um

5651
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,800
that that goes into like the rhyme

5653
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,679
because i'm literally trying to figure

5655
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,760
out the video game

5657
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:25,199
at all times and see where these things

5659
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,560
uh parallel i know this can get into

5661
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:27,840
like a riff where people like

5663
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:31,119
okay yeah you're losing what you're

5665
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,119
saying right now but um

5667
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:35,840
but look at that look at the dictionary

5669
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:36,480
look at these words i have friends uh

5671
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:38,400
that

5673
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,000
uh english is their second or third or

5675
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:41,760
eighth language and they say that

5677
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,960
english is the hardest

5679
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,800
language to learn because there's so

5681
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,440
many words to

5683
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:49,520
uh to that mean the same thing it it

5685
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:52,560
like it tears me to my core that

5687
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:54,480
my daughter has to learn two the

5689
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:57,520
difference between two t-o-o

5691
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:59,760
and t-o i wanna just be like

5693
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:01,760
just draw the number two like just make

5695
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:03,360
it like sometimes i don't know

5697
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:05,119
when you know the difference i'm like a

5699
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:06,480
terrible speller

5701
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:09,360
and i believe that there's like

5703
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:12,719
curriculums that are that are european

5705
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:14,960
curriculums that don't even apply to

5707
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:17,040
our genes you know who we are as a

5709
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:19,119
people like african descent people

5711
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:20,639
we don't even talk like that like this

5713
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:23,040
is a skill set but i'm still

5715
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:24,880
talking white basically like you'll see

5717
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:27,040
like a black pastor

5719
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,960
you know give this amazing like sermon

5721
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:30,400
or like marry someone i was at a wedding

5723
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,320
and this guy

5725
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,679
they said wow he speaks so well well

5727
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:37,119
what do you mean well he speaks

5729
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:38,560
super white like yeah that's what the

5731
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:40,719
definition of well

5733
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:42,480
right right it's just sounds that you

5735
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:44,239
use and to communicate ideas

5737
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,600
right yeah well it's funny i bumped it

5739
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:48,080
to a friend of mine

5741
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,840
um i actually met williams i said uh

5743
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:53,679
givenchy i wasn't expecting to see

5745
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:56,159
i wasn't expecting i mean expecting

5747
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:57,040
to see him i wasn't expecting to see him

5749
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,880
and

5751
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:00,159
we're at the mercer lobby and he caught

5753
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:04,239
me off guard

5755
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:08,159
and i was like i didn't use words

5757
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:09,920
when when i when i when i saw him i like

5759
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:11,679
almost communicated in a different

5761
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,280
language like a language like joy or

5763
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:14,480
happiness only 30 percent of our

5765
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:16,880
communication

5767
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:18,560
is is verbal that's why the masks just

5769
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:21,600
really throw me off because

5771
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:24,400
i can't tell what someone

5773
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,920
is thinking and feeling because a lot of

5775
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:27,280
times half the time people don't say

5777
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:30,320
what they're thinking and feeling

5779
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:33,040
and i have to decode with the mask

5781
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:33,600
i can only you know hear what they're

5783
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,040
saying

5785
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,880
that's the problem with social media too

5787
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,760
right yes things are black and white and

5789
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,840
things being

5791
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:41,119
taken out of context i mean that's the

5793
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,719
reason why people

5795
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:44,400
like you know love the show that they're

5797
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:46,960
like oh we got the yay

5799
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:47,760
joe rogan we can hear him go into all of

5801
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:51,600
these riffs

5803
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:53,280
yeah and we can feel him you could see

5805
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,040
you know how i'm looking you can see my

5807
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:56,719
energy and the way i'm saying it too

5809
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:58,800
yeah so and

5811
01:42:56,719 --> 01:43:00,080
you see people sitting down having an

5813
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,800
actual conversation

5815
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:04,080
a real conversation yeah and and a

5817
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:06,560
conversation where

5819
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:07,679
anybody that comes on this show you

5821
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:11,199
don't have like this

5823
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:12,000
like sometimes with reporters they have

5825
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:13,760
like

5827
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,920
people that are media they have like a

5829
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:16,719
complex you don't have a complex you're

5831
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,320
like yo

5833
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:19,920
let's first off to get this straight

5835
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:21,520
like if i like

5837
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,280
i could whip your ass i'm joe rogan i'm

5839
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:24,239
a professional fighter now let's start

5841
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,159
the conversation

5843
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:27,360
which i think is another reason like

5845
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:29,440
with nick cannon he's like

5847
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:31,280
man i married mariah carey i did all

5849
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:33,040
these and both of these interviews have

5851
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:34,080
been very positive because people aren't

5853
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,080
carrying

5855
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:38,480
something already like some form of chip

5857
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:40,639
on their shoulder where they gotta like

5859
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:41,760
atta every sentence sometimes i talk to

5861
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:43,520
reporters it's like

5863
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,760
they're saying the thing they wanted to

5865
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:46,960
say to this guy in high school that they

5867
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,639
never got to

5869
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,239
complete the conversation and they're

5871
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:53,760
taking it out

5873
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:55,360
on me i'm like

5875
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:56,960
yeah i think there's a lot of people

5877
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,840
that have conversations with people and

5879
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,320
they want to

5881
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:01,520
create a viral moment too that it's not

5883
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:03,840
just a conversation

5885
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:04,880
they they have an agenda it's it's

5887
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,560
almost like you were talking about the

5889
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:09,520
disney star wars movies

5891
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:11,040
that then it's not a work of art it's

5893
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:13,520
it's a formula

5895
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:15,199
like two plus two is four let's put

5897
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:17,280
those together we'll make some money

5899
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:19,119
instead of the original star wars which

5901
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:20,560
was the hero's journey which was like a

5903
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:22,880
joseph campbell book

5905
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:23,920
it's just like there was a beauty and a

5907
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,520
purity to it

5909
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:27,520
it's a it's an expression like someone

5911
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,480
comes up with an idea and they bring it

5913
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,760
to fruition

5915
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:31,840
and then you get to watch and you're

5917
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:33,920
like wow it moves you

5919
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,960
the new movies don't move you and it was

5921
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:39,119
a crew

5923
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:40,320
of of um of leaders of thought leaders

5925
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:43,840
that like i was a

5927
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:45,840
is it brian de palma that told george to

5929
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:47,360
put the words at the beginning because

5931
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:49,040
it's like you really

5933
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:51,199
i all i've been feeling like is like

5935
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:52,880

01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:58,080
you know and then the toys from star

5941
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:58,719

5943
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,560

01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:23,760
being you know self-absorbed or the

5969
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:26,800
center of your own universe

5971
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:29,199

he gets this esther

5991
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:57,360
and it was awesome yeah there's there's

5993
01:45:56,320 --> 01:46:00,080
something about

5995
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:01,040
uh things that are pure right versus

5997
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:03,360
things that are

5999
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,960
attempting to recreate something that

6001
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,800
people are going to like

6003
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,800
there's there's a difference and it's

6005
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,639
it's in music as well right like

6007
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:12,080
your your music resonates with people

6009
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:12,800
because it's obviously coming from your

6011
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:15,360
mind

6013
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:17,280
whereas some people are creating songs

6015
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:19,760
that they think are going to be hits

6017
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:20,639
they're creating top 40 it's coming from

6019
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:24,159
my heart

6021
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:26,159
and my gut but when it's the most pure

6023
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:28,239
it's coming from god and i'm being used

6025
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:31,280
as a channel it's like when

6027
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:33,520
tanya harden hit the the triple flip

6029
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:34,480
you know she had all that skill and then

6031
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:36,880
at some point

6033
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:39,119
it's not called a trip i'm about to say

6035
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,560
trippy triple lindy like is rajiv

6037
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:42,560
or rodney dangerfield or something but

6039
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:45,119
it's like

6041
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,320
there's these moments where we do things

6043
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:48,400
that are

6045
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,520
seem like superhero level and i think

6047
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:52,960
that's what m knight

6049
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:56,480
shalamon was laying out for us

6051
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:58,320
with unbreakable uh

6053
01:46:56,480 --> 01:47:00,000
glass and what was the other one with

6055
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,760
the guy with the multiple personalities

6057
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,480
just like he's got three of these

6059
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,880
films that are like showing us hey

01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:07,280

superheroes you can believe it the

6065
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:12,800

6083
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:39,119

and i just completely pull like put it

6095
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:50,880
off to the side

6097
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:52,400
because i was like shivering and you

6099
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,159
know having the shakes and taking hot

6101
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:56,400
showers and eating soup and

6103
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:57,440
you know just sleeping i don't think it

6105
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:00,639
was that bad

6107
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:04,480
i think it was a mild case um

6109
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:06,159
and it just threw off i mean it threw

6111
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,960
everyone off it threw everybody's plans

6113
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:09,440
off

6115
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,880
and then you know it was just this

6117
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:12,159
calling on my heart and i remember

6119
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:16,159
talking to like really like

6121
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:18,880
elitist um uh

6123
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:20,480
you know writers you know i was trying

6125
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,800
to avoid saying white supremacists but

6127
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:24,159
like

6129
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:29,040
elite like the the the liberal elites

6131
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:29,040
are like you know so

6133
01:48:29,199 --> 01:48:32,560
boy who you gonna vote on you know like

6135
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:35,840
who are you to run for

6137
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:36,400
office and why would you sign up for

6139
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:39,280
office

6141
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:40,480
you know uh if you if you can't even get

6143
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:42,960
on ballots

6145
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:44,400
that's people are saying that to me and

6147
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,320
i could get on the ballot

6149
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,520
it's like there's black mothers that go

6151
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,800
into hospital

6153
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:50,080
and the doctor will tell them that

6155
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,800
there's something wrong with their child

6157
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:54,159
to get them

6159
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:55,600
to this is happening uh to this date

6161
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:57,760
and then when people say you know are

6163
01:48:55,600 --> 01:49:01,600
you are you a pawn

6165
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:04,400
like for the republicans

6167
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:06,000
the reason why i think that people are

6169
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:07,760
asking me that is because the

6171
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,199
because the democrats do create black

6173
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:11,440
pawns

6175
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:12,960
they do have celebrities that they'll

6177
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:14,400
sit down and meet with and say you're

6179
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:17,280
going to be an advocate

6181
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:19,040
for the democratic party and you know

6183
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,639
everyone's like

6185
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:22,400
you know and i'm not trying to take any

6187
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:23,679
sides of like republicans or democrats

6189
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:26,159
i'm just saying why where

6191
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:27,440
why were people so much thinking that i

6193
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:32,159
was like

6195
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:35,440
uh a form of uh a pawn and then the idea

6197
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:37,520
that you know liberals would say like

6199
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:39,920
the funny thing is liberals i think uh

6201
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:42,639
and i'm i'm

6203
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:43,760
i don't know if i could classify myself

6205
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:45,599
as liberal but

6207
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:47,040
i'm i'm definitely kind of liberal elite

6209
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:49,360
i wrote my beautiful dark twisted

6211
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:52,719
fantasy like i've had some of the best

6213
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:56,080
writing so that would put me in that

6215
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:58,159
class so to say but i'm also just a

6217
01:49:56,080 --> 01:50:00,080
purist like i see a kenyan home and be

6219
01:49:58,159 --> 01:50:00,800
like that's beautiful right there i'm

6221
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:04,080
not like

6223
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:06,400
i gotta have the so the

6225
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,840
one of the most racist things that

6227
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:09,040
liberals who pride themselves on not

6229
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,320
being racist

6231
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:13,760
have said to me is like uh you're gonna

6233
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:17,040
split the black vote

6235
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:20,000
and that makes it seem like black people

6237
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:20,320
can't make decisions for ourselves and

6239
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,719
that

6241
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:23,520
don't know white people know me like i'm

6243
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:24,800
like only

6245
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:26,560
the liberal they literally make it

6247
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:28,800
saying like only

6249
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,320
black people will vote for me right

6251
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:33,920
think about that statement the

6253
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:37,119
the nuance of institutionalized

6255
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:38,000
racism and this would be like somebody

6257
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:40,320
from the art world

6259
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,280
you know i mean they just have a place

6261
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,520
where

6263
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:44,880
no one has really been able to embrace

6265
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:48,960
the idea

6267
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:51,679
of blacks not being in a block

6269
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:52,960
and staying in one place right or blacks

6271
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:55,119
having a devote democrat

6273
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,719
yeah or blacks have an opinion like us

6275
01:50:55,119 --> 01:51:00,080
not being on boards or

6277
01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:01,360
us being like handlers for other black

6279
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:03,360
people meaning like

6281
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:04,560
if we work at a label or we work at a

6283
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:06,639
big corporation

6285
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:07,840
it's our job to go talk to the other

6287
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:10,800
black people

6289
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:12,719
you know to calm other black people down

6291
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:16,159
but we're working for

6293
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:20,080
you know uh universal or vivendi

6295
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:21,679
or uh whatever the

6297
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:23,440
organizations were you know i was

6299
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:25,520
thinking about buying my masters and i

6301
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,560
realized that that was too small of a

6303
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:29,920
thought

6305
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:32,880
i'm gonna buy universal

6307
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:34,239
they're only a 33 billion organization

6309
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:35,199
i'm one of the greatest product

6311
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:38,000
producers

6313
01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:38,880
that ever existed i'm i'm and i'm a

6315
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,360
child

6317
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:42,880
i'm 43 years old i was 53 million

6319
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:46,159
dollars in debt

6321
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:48,800
uh uh you know four years ago

6323
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:49,840
and now it's proven that i'm the new

6325
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:53,599
michael jordan

6327
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:56,880
of products i went to adidas and

6329
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:59,360
we were a 15 billion organization

6331
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:01,040
losing 2 billion before kova hit our

6333
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:04,800
market cap was 68 billion

6335
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:05,599
i went to the gap and are partnered with

6337
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:09,440
the gap

6339
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:12,560
and our stock jumped 45

6341
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:13,920
in two hours the organization made two

6343
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:17,040
billion dollars

6345
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:20,320
and two out in two hours and now

6347
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:22,000
we've doubled we i mean the gap was uh

6349
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:23,599
mark cap was lower than yeezy it was

6351
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,280
like three billion dollars

6353
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:26,719
when when when i first got there now

6355
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,800
it's like seven

6357
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:30,880
eight billion dollars and we haven't

6359
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:33,280
even released the product yet

6361
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:35,040
but what i loved i you know i sat there

6363
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,080
and i did the deal without getting on

6365
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:39,119
the board

6367
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:40,400
and i looked at my cousin and i and i i

6369
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:41,360
didn't want to sign the deal without

6371
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,800
being on the board and i looked at him

6373
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:44,560
and said i'm doing this for you

6375
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:46,800
meaning like this is part of a relay

6377
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:49,840
race it would just be a given

6379
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:52,159
that if someone of color

6381
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,880
was to your position my position of

6383
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:54,960
influence

6385
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:56,880
would be on the board but michael jordan

6387
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:58,320
had to break down walls

6389
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:00,159
and michael jackson had to break down

6391
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:02,480
walls for

6393
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:03,760
us to break down the next walls and the

6395
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:05,040
next walls are

6397
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,040
the boardroom because you know what the

6399
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:09,760
boardroom is it's an opinion

6401
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:11,280
see people are fine for us to play

6403
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:15,119
basketball and

6405
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:20,080
you know rap and make clothes

6407
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:21,920
but the the society is set up is not

6409
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:23,360
really used to refine with us actually

6411
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:25,440
having an opinion

6413
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:27,119
and i can understand why because what is

6415
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:30,239
our opinion based on

6417
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:32,480
if we grew up thinking we were slaves

6419
01:53:30,239 --> 01:53:34,080
if our opinion isn't based on hey my dad

6421
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:36,320
taught me how to run this company

6423
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:37,760
you know my dad is smarter than me and

6425
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:39,920
everything he wanted to do

6427
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:41,199
black people thought he was crazy and he

6429
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:42,800
had to do it with

6431
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:44,880
white people who thought he was

6433
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:48,960
incompetent because he was black

6435
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:51,760
and the way these companies and the way

6437
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:54,800
uh the music industry the way managers

6439
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:57,840
and the way society generally looks at

6441
01:53:54,800 --> 01:54:00,880
uh black people is

6443
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:02,880
the way like a misogynistic man looks at

6445
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:05,440
a hot lady

6447
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,920
what can you give me what can you do for

6449
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,760
me

6451
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:10,000
no one a misogynistic man not gonna look

6453
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:13,920
at a hot lady and say

6455
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:16,800
can you run my company so

6457
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:18,159
you know this idea of me you know and i

6459
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:19,679
i i got like

6461
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:21,199
you know i'm building my factories i've

6463
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:24,080
just simplified the design

6465
01:54:21,199 --> 01:54:24,560
and i was working with a guy that uh you

6467
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:27,119
know

6469
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:28,480
um that's helping me to you know build

6471
01:54:27,119 --> 01:54:29,280
some of the factories it was an older

6473
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,199
white gentleman

6475
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:32,719
and he just matter-of-factly says we're

6477
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:34,960
sitting at his house

6479
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:35,760
uh in malibu it's a nice day he's just

6481
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:38,320
matter of fact

6483
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:39,520
he says adidas will never put you on the

6485
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:42,719
board

6487
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:45,679
and i'm like this this wall

6489
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:46,960
has to come down like how could you not

6491
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:48,639
have the guy

6493
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:50,800
that has the best idea so one of the

6495
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:52,239
great things with universal one of the

6497
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:54,960
approaches that we have is

6499
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:55,760
you know universal when jimmy iveen and

6501
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:58,800
dr dre

6503
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:02,480
sold beats by dre uh universal had a

6505
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:03,840
chance to buy in or do different things

6507
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:06,159
they sold it for three billion dollars

6509
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:08,239
that was half of the value

6511
01:55:06,159 --> 01:55:09,520
of universal at that time of six billion

6513
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:12,960
due to the internet which

6515
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:17,280
the music industry was afraid of in 2000

6517
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:20,320
universal now i think is a

6519
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:24,800
worth 33 bill 35 billion dollars

6521
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:27,360
um and now they have another steve jobs

6523
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:28,400
you know howard hughes henry iv disney

6525
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:32,400
elon

6527
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:35,840
kind of character within their midst

6529
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:38,960
but they're so concerned about

6531
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:40,719
the control of the idea of

6533
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:43,199
artists because they're using me as like

6535
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:44,159
this artist that has attracted other

6537
01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:47,119
artists

6539
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:48,719
it also i use them i got famous i made

6541
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:50,719
some money i got to tour

6543
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:52,560
you know i became this superstar so we

6545
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:53,920
use each other now this is just an

6547
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:55,040
adjustment that needs to be made in the

6549
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:58,000
relationship

6551
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:59,360
and i can make and i will make products

6553
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,119
that

6555
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:03,840
will make more money than universal is

6557
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:05,760
worth

6559
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:08,159
but it's not about the money as i said

6561
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:10,639
earlier it's about the fact

6563
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:11,599
that even though my net worth is five

6565
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:12,960
billion dollars

6567
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:15,040
and i'm one of the most famous most

6569
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:18,880
influential god-fearing

6571
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:21,840
christians on the planet the

6573
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:22,880
i still have to go to this man or this

6575
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,440
organization

6577
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:26,800
and ask him for something and that is

6579
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,199
what it's about you can have a company

6581
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:28,480
right

6583
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:30,400
when you go and do your companies don't

6585
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:32,560
think because you got the most ownership

6587
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:34,239
that you actually have the control if

6589
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:36,080
you don't have the information

6591
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:37,840
and the knowledge of how the

6593
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:39,599
distribution works

6595
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:41,360
and you're not having that conversation

6597
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:42,719
you don't have the control so what i did

6599
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:45,760
in my organization

6601
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:48,159
with universal with gap and with adidas

6603
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:49,520
i told my lawyers my managers everything

6605
01:56:48,159 --> 01:56:51,760
no one can communicate

6607
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:53,040
with these organizations except for me

6609
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:56,239
you can give me advice

6611
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:57,119
but they gotta talk to the boss which is

6613
01:56:56,239 --> 01:56:59,920
me

6615
01:56:57,119 --> 01:57:00,960
and right there you start to get the

6617
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:05,040
information flow

6619
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:08,320
i guess who's my cfo who me

6621
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:11,520
so that means i do have the time i do

6623
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:14,960
10 to 15 transactions

6625
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:16,880

people who weren't on the salary but

6637
01:57:24,159 --> 01:57:28,159

01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:44,320

6653
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:46,159
winfrey moment where she's like

6655
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:48,000
man when i started spending cash i was

6657
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:49,840

6659
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,360
you know how much i was spending and i

6661
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:52,960
signed all my own checks and the thing

6663
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:54,800
that happens in the music industry

6665
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:56,239
uh is and just a lot of industries like

6667
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:57,440
people tell you that someone needs to do

6669
01:57:56,239 --> 01:58:00,080
something for you

6671
01:57:57,440 --> 01:58:01,679
and it's like look this siri do

6673
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:04,080
everything for you know you can do

6675
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:05,760
it's possible and it's just when you ask

6677
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:07,920
me how do i delegate my time

6679
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:09,199
it's important for me to delegate my

6681
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:12,320
time if i made

6683
01:58:09,199 --> 01:58:14,000
210 million dollars last year

6685
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:15,679
and yeah i have a lot of maverick ideas

6687
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,520
i'm working on cities and homeless

6689
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:18,560
shelters and farms and i'm reinvesting

6691
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:20,719
myself so a lot of

6693
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:23,360
mavericks will you know spend their

6695
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:24,880
money on their ideas and they'll invest

6697
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:26,880
in what they see the future is and i

6699
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:27,760
ended up with a net worth of 10 million

6701
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:30,320
i remember

6703
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:30,960
you know a few a month ago people were

6705
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:33,599
like

6707
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:34,719
you can't show your taxes because people

6709
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:35,520
won't understand that you're a

6711
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:37,280
billionaire

6713
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:39,280
if they see that you only netted 10

6715
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:42,239
million last year

6717
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:42,960
and after the gap deal happened my net

6719
01:58:42,239 --> 01:58:46,239
worth

6721
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:49,360
went from 3.3 billion

6723
01:58:46,239 --> 01:58:50,400
to 5 billion and i had been asking the

6725
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:51,840
people around me

6727
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:54,639
to run the story and they were going to

6729
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:57,040
run it with bloomberg they never ran it

6731
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:58,639
i was not afraid of people looking at me

6733
01:58:57,040 --> 01:59:02,159
like i was not a billionaire

6735
01:58:58,639 --> 01:59:02,639
and i said be honest show my taxes show

6737
01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:04,639
every

6739
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:07,440
everything and then the reports came

6741
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:10,800
back oh you're worth 5 billion

6743
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:12,480
it came from me just being honest when i

6745
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:14,080
want to say something about the gap deal

6747
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,480
also and specifically the name the gap

6749
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:17,520
in my

6751
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:19,360
and my journey with that like at age 16

6753
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:20,400

i had to do for sunday service or i got

6817
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:25,040
to do that was fun for me to do

6819

was to design the wardrobe for sunday

6821
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:29,840
service and we would redesign

6823
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:31,520
t-shirts and it says in the bible that

6825
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:32,159
jesus wore a seamless garment so we

6827
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:33,679
started

6829
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:36,000
building t-shirts where the scene was

6831
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:38,159
only here or only

6833
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,440
two seams on the shirt or moving it

6835
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:41,360
around and what the neck was

6837
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:42,880
and i made t-shirt after t-shirt after

6839
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:44,000
t-shirt and christianity we said we

6841
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:46,960
stand in the gap

6843
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:48,239

6845
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,760
presented

6847
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:51,280
and i always had clothes that were kind

6849
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:53,040
of chill like they could be at the gap

6851
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:56,719
they were not overly fashionable

6853
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:58,400
and god said you you you stood in the

6855
02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:00,080
gap

6857
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:02,639

6871
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:14,800

6907
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:49,840
take down

6909
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:51,360
goliath we hit the street you know it's

a stock

6935
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:14,719
by 45 percent you see think about this

6937
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:17,119

6941
02:02:17,119 --> 02:02:20,880
a rapper you're only it's like

be my kryptonite i won't let other

6957
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:33,840
people's opinions

6959
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:35,840
be my kryptonite i won't let these

6961
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:38,000
labels that people put on me

6963
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:39,760
be my kryptonite and a lot of times i

6965
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,159
don't like to watch these interviews

6967
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:43,599
back until about you know three four

6969
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:46,400
five years later because

6971
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:48,159
i'm always you know i'm visiting the now

6973
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,719
i'm existing in the future and visiting

6975
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:51,119
the now

6977
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:52,320
when i'm speaking to you and they make a

6979
02:02:51,119 --> 02:02:54,639
lot more sense

6981
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:55,599
in the future because i can tell you but

6983
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:56,960
he can show you

6985
02:02:55,599 --> 02:02:58,480
god can show you so a lot of stuff i'm

6987
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:59,920
telling you and some people are

6989
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:00,480
following me some people are believing

6991
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:02,800
in it

6993
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:04,239
and some people are just doubting it

6995
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:05,440
because they want to put this label oh

6997
02:03:04,239 --> 02:03:07,440
he's crazy or

6999
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:08,480
it's just a black guy saying it or it's

7001
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:10,800
just a rapper

7003
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:12,239
it's just a it's just an entertainer

7005
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:15,599
it's just whatever it is

7007
02:03:12,239 --> 02:03:17,119
so i can say the most wild ideas out

7009
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:17,840
loud it's like veronica corningstone

7011
02:03:17,119 --> 02:03:21,280
wanting to be an

7013
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:22,480
anchor person and i remember she said so

7015
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:24,719
ron i told you

7017
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:25,599
i wanted to be a he said yes i heard you

7019
02:03:24,719 --> 02:03:27,599
i wrote it down

7021
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:29,679
veronica corningston had a very funny

7023
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:31,599
joke tonight and every time i talk

7025
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:33,360
it's literally like veronica cornerstone

7027
02:03:31,599 --> 02:03:34,239
having a very funny joke tonight like

7029
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:34,880
when i said i was gonna run for

7031
02:03:34,239 --> 02:03:36,960

7035
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:39,920

02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:41,280
do you have thoughts and ideas also that

7039
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:43,280
you'd like to have be a part of your

7041
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:44,800
interview well you went from

7043
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:46,400
you went from people mad at you that you

7045
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:48,000
split in the back black vote

7047
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:49,760
all the way to the gap and all the way

7049
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,679
to veronica i made it

7051
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:53,040
but then i brought it back yes you did

7053
02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:55,520
to the vote to run it for you

7055
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:57,199
brought it back from to people doubting

7057
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,679
you and people putting limitations on

7059
02:03:57,199 --> 02:03:59,360
you

7061
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:01,040
people are tuning in this podcast to go

7063
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:03,119
on the journey with us yeah

7065
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:04,400
listen they do or they don't it's up to

7067
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:05,440
them yeah but do you know

7069
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:07,040
the beautiful thing is you're not

7071
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:07,920
listening to these people these people

7073
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,360
that are trying to

7075
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:11,679
put these labels on you and tell you

7077
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:14,400
what to do and

7079
02:04:11,679 --> 02:04:15,679
you're not saddled down by fear you're

7081
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:17,280
not settled down by

7083
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:19,119
doubt you're you're willing to take

7085
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:20,560
these chances if you did become

7087
02:04:19,119 --> 02:04:22,880
president what would you do that was

7089
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:22,880
different

7091
02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:26,960
i mean pretty much everything i was just

7093
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:27,500
looking at the suits last night i was

7095
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:29,119

7097
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:31,040
[Laughter]

7099
02:04:29,119 --> 02:04:33,040

7103
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:37,119

7105
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:40,400
like a i just

7107
02:04:37,119 --> 02:04:42,639
um i would i would

7109
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:44,000
redesign this i i will and it's not a

7111
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:48,880
wood right it's not a if

7113
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,880
it's not a if it's just when right um

7115
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:52,800
we got to start with the budget i feel

7117
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:54,719
like

7119
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:56,159
you know the fact that i went from being

7121
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:59,760
in debt

7123
02:04:56,159 --> 02:05:02,719
to uh to

7125
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:03,760
uh being i don't even like the way it

7127
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:05,760
sounds the multi-billion because we

7129
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:06,079
think about steve jobs money is like the

7131
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:08,960
least

7133
02:05:06,079 --> 02:05:10,480
of what's awesome about him and the

7135
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:12,239
money is just a tool like it's like

7137
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:14,000
nails like i got the most names you feel

7139
02:05:12,239 --> 02:05:14,480
like it's scored on the scoreboard

7141
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,920
though

7143
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:18,560
it proves it proves not just value but

7145
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:20,480
it proves

7147
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:22,560
effectiveness yeah and it's like you're

7149
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:23,199
crazy to your right so it proves in some

7151
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,400
way that

7153
02:05:23,199 --> 02:05:26,480
a lot of the things i said that were

7155
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:28,880
crazy i was actually right about yeah

7157
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:30,320
looking at that budget and i think that

7159
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:33,040
that's part of god's like

7161
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:34,000
training like mr miyagi paint defense

7163
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:37,280
you know karate kid

7165
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,480
daniel son i on that i gave like the

7167
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:41,280
full description of the

7169
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:42,000
uh of the analogy just in case uh people

7171
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:43,520
didn't um

7173
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,360
what do you think you would do though if

7175
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:47,520
they come to you with talks about

7177
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:48,960
foreign policy people love talking about

7179
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,639
foreign policy that's the number one uh

7181
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:52,000
question yeah but when i talk about the

7183
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:54,239
budget

7185
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,239
you know this paint the fence the fact

7187
02:05:54,239 --> 02:06:00,880
that i had to

7189
02:05:56,239 --> 02:06:04,239
you know that i have to understand

7191
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:05,760
300 million dollars of cash a year that

7193
02:06:04,239 --> 02:06:07,920
you don't get trained for that that's

7195
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:08,719
like astronaut training that i have to

7197
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:11,440
understand

7199
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:12,560
how to have multiple industries that i

7201
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:15,760
have to understand

7203
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:19,119
how to build and

7205
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:21,440
house and provide

7207
02:06:19,119 --> 02:06:22,400
you know i i provide people with health

7209
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:24,400
care and i could

7211
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:25,760
i had this idea of doing a zero employee

7213
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:29,440
org where

7215
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:30,880
i i put everything on my partners on

7217
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:34,239
universal on the gap

7219
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:35,440
on adidas but i believe this is amazing

7221
02:06:34,239 --> 02:06:38,639
training for me as a

7223
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:39,760
a black person there's people who who

7225
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:43,440
have been

7227
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:44,079
raised to respect a penny but as a black

7229
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:46,960
person

7231
02:06:44,079 --> 02:06:48,400
i've been raised to look down at a penny

7233
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:51,199
but the people who really

7235
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:52,880
hold their money respect every penny

7237
02:06:51,199 --> 02:06:54,800
they respect the money

7239
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:56,960
and it's interesting i had an argument

7241
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:58,480
with uh one of my managers because i

7243
02:06:56,960 --> 02:07:01,199
made my own travel ban

7245
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:01,599
in my organization because you know i

7247
02:07:01,199 --> 02:07:02,960
did

7249
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:04,880
when i did sunday service a month and a

7251
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:06,159
half ago it was 25 flights coming in and

7253
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:07,520
people i didn't know

7255
02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:09,920
because there's criminals in my

7257
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:13,599
organization trying to kill bob marley

7259
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:15,599
not to jfk or mlk me but deplete my

7261
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:17,599
resources

7263
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:19,360
so i created this travel explain that

7265
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:21,199
what do you mean by that what i mean by

7267
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:22,400
criminals in your organization like what

7269
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:25,360
do you mean meaning

7271
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:27,599
there's people that okay i fired this

7273
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:30,159
one cfo

7275
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:32,880
about three months ago and up to a week

7277
02:07:30,159 --> 02:07:35,360
ago he still had an open credit card

7279
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:37,679
because i i'm gonna dig lower and dick

7281
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:39,199
lower and go to it it's like always like

7283
02:07:37,679 --> 02:07:40,800
is this the new person that's in charge

7285
02:07:39,199 --> 02:07:41,360
of your money it's like no i'm the new

7287
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:43,280
person

7289
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:44,960
that's in charge of your money that's in

7291
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:47,360
charge of my money rather

7293
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:48,560
so so that's why you became your cfo

7295
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:50,639
that's why i became and it's

7297
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:52,159
it's the best and it's it clears my

7299
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:55,360
thoughts and it really helps me

7301
02:07:52,159 --> 02:07:58,560
with design it helps me as i'm designing

7303
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:59,840
uh uh designing uh what i'm doing at the

7305
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:02,400
gap it helps me

7307
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:03,520
when i'm how i'm designing the

7309
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:05,360
curriculum it helps me

7311
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:07,119
in the way i'm designing the kitchen the

7313
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:07,760
way i'm delegating the way i'm working

7315
02:08:07,119 --> 02:08:10,960
the way i'm

7317
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:13,599
and being a better leader being a better

7319
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:14,639
uh being a better listener wait a second

7321
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:15,679
but there was some question you had i

7323
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:17,520
had i was answering

7325
02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:18,960
and i gave it all before you went to

7327
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:20,880
foreign policies i went to the

7329
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:23,040
the budget well i said it's like

7331
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:25,440
danielson painting the fence

7333
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:26,639
the fact that i've had to really look at

7335
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:29,360
and understand

7337
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:30,400
that kind of money and this god-given

7339
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:33,040
anointing

7341
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:34,560
being a producer being a head of

7343
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:38,719
industry to be

7345
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:41,199
a fearing and god and a servant of god

7347
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:43,040
and a producer and head of industry at

7349
02:08:41,199 --> 02:08:45,599
the same time

7351
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:47,040
is literally like the perfect

7353
02:08:45,599 --> 02:08:50,159
combination

7355
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:52,159
for a president and to be honest i'm

7357
02:08:50,159 --> 02:08:55,760
literally like every now and then

7359
02:08:52,159 --> 02:08:56,880
america has to get america deserves the

7361
02:08:55,760 --> 02:09:00,320
world deserves

7363
02:08:56,880 --> 02:09:04,159
a leader that they can 100 percent

7365
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:06,719
trust that whatever i'm saying

7367
02:09:04,159 --> 02:09:07,760
to you with the information that i have

7369
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:11,280
in front of me

7371
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:13,760
i 100 believe that

7373
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:15,440
like when i talked to the uh when i was

7375
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:18,560
with the president of haiti

7377
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:19,440
and he gave us an island me and shervin

7379
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:22,239
pisivar

7381
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:23,760
that was an early angel investor at uber

7383
02:09:22,239 --> 02:09:26,639
and is working on the uh

7385
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:28,320
the virgin hyperloop right now a really

7387
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:30,639
great friend of mine he saved me

7389
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:32,639
he's had me avoid deals where i was

7391
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:34,239
gonna give up a percentage of my company

7393
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:35,119
for a third of the value and different

7395
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:38,239
things like that

7397
02:09:35,119 --> 02:09:41,920
so uh we go to haiti and the president

7399
02:09:38,239 --> 02:09:45,280
uh uh gives us this island to develop

7401
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:47,440
uh to make a city of the future and also

7403
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:48,560
we're gonna have the farmers and the

7405
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:50,960
people who live there

7407
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:52,079
take a percentage i mean take ownership

7409
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:54,239
of the land that they have right now so

7411
02:09:52,079 --> 02:09:58,000
when it raises in value

7413
02:09:54,239 --> 02:10:02,079
they all eat off of uh what the idea is

7415
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:04,880
but he said that um

7417
02:10:02,079 --> 02:10:06,079
the way that he has done uh business

7419
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:09,119
with our president

7421
02:10:06,079 --> 02:10:11,599
is so straightforward

7423
02:10:09,119 --> 02:10:13,440
i believe that i know that me as

7425
02:10:11,599 --> 02:10:15,040
president would be the best thing that

7427
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:17,360
ever happened for america's

7429
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:18,639
foreign policy i've traveled more than

7431
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:21,360
any president

7433
02:10:18,639 --> 02:10:22,880
already and i bring people together i

7435
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:26,159
put rivals

7437
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:28,880
on songs together to create masterpieces

7439
02:10:26,159 --> 02:10:29,599
i go and i empathize when i meet with

7441
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:32,639
leaders

7443
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:35,920
in africa when i meet with leaders in

7445
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:37,360
um i didn't really have a good uh next

7447
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:38,079
thing i wanted to sound good and like

7449
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:41,330
naming

7451
02:10:38,079 --> 02:10:47,170
leaders and i wanted to sound

7453
02:10:41,330 --> 02:10:47,170
[Laughter]

7455
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:50,800
see honestly so when i when i meet with

7457
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:52,639
when i meet with leaders

7459
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:54,719
i'm not trying to go in there and see

7461
02:10:52,639 --> 02:10:56,639
how they can use my internet i'm not

7463
02:10:54,719 --> 02:10:57,280
trying to go in there and buy up their

7465
02:10:56,639 --> 02:11:00,639
land

7467
02:10:57,280 --> 02:11:03,040
and develop it and buy it up for cheap

7469
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:04,079
you know we're we're going to share

7471
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:07,199
information

7473
02:11:04,079 --> 02:11:10,320
you know we're uh you know we have

7475
02:11:07,199 --> 02:11:11,119
a idea we just had of a dual citizenship

7477
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:14,880
for

7479
02:11:11,119 --> 02:11:18,079
americans with african uh dissent uh

7481
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:20,239
that the ability to create

7483
02:11:18,079 --> 02:11:21,440
environments and communities completely

7485
02:11:20,239 --> 02:11:24,880
can change

7487
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:27,040
the way uh

7489
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:28,320
people act you know if people are hungry

7491
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:29,840
they're gonna act a certain way

7493
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:31,280
people have food they're gonna act a

7495
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:32,400
certain way people are away from their

7497
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:33,920
friends and family they're gonna act a

7499
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:35,520
certain way they're gonna need to

7501
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:38,079
they're at a college town they need to

7503
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:38,480
stop by this you know frat party and you

7505
02:11:38,079 --> 02:11:41,679
know

7507
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:43,440
drink and do the but when they're uh

7509
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:45,040
you know but you got to go here so then

7511
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,679
you could go there and like society is

7513
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:48,079
all about

7515
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:50,560
dismantling the family i see things

7517
02:11:48,079 --> 02:11:52,079
being more like a kibbutz or

7519
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:54,000
you know where the family can be as

7521
02:11:52,079 --> 02:11:56,719
close and when the grandparents can be

7523
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,199
next to the children and um you know

7525
02:11:56,719 --> 02:12:00,320
these

7527
02:11:57,199 --> 02:12:03,840
ideas i have about um

7529
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:06,480
how communities uh ca should be

7531
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:08,000
are worldwide simplified ideas and that

7533
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:09,440
they're not based on

7535
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,000
industry even though i understand

7537
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:14,480
industry they're based on serving god

7539
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,840
and serving families and that's

7541
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:18,800
something that

7543
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:19,920
everyone across the globe no matter what

7545
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:21,199
country in the world whatever

7547
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:23,119
continental world

7549
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:24,639
all of the moms and dads have something

7551
02:12:23,119 --> 02:12:26,159
in common they want the world to be

7553
02:12:24,639 --> 02:12:28,400
better for their children

7555
02:12:26,159 --> 02:12:29,440
we all want the world to be better for

7557
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:32,480
the children

7559
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:34,079
and we can show ways that we are not at

7561
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:38,000
odds think about the world is a

7563
02:12:34,079 --> 02:12:40,880
giant piano but we're playing off-key

7565
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,760
so for a producer to synthesize those

7567
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:43,840
ideas

7569
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:45,119
and not say okay we're gonna shut i

7571
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:48,159
spent time in china

7573
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:49,679
i spent a year in china when i was uh in

7575
02:12:48,159 --> 02:12:52,800
fifth grade i used to speak

7577
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:55,360
chinese like new york like i

7579
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:55,920
i don't know a lot of yeah my mom was an

7581
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:57,520
english

7583
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,280
professor they had an exchange program

7585
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:01,520
where a chinese student could

7587
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:02,800
come to america and she could go to

7589
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:04,719
which was there was

7591
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:06,000
like chinese at that time couldn't come

7593
02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:10,320
to america

7595
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:14,560
as uh as easily so

7597
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:18,239
you know there's america's greatest

7599
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:21,360
export is influence and

7601
02:13:18,239 --> 02:13:23,280
culture china actually has like

7603
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:25,199
imitation paris imitation they probably

7605
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:28,719
got imitation calabasas at this

7607
02:13:25,199 --> 02:13:31,440
they probably do at this point you know

7609
02:13:28,719 --> 02:13:32,960
the the artists define culture that's

7611
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:35,280
what makes there's the artist

7613
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:36,079
that made the design the statue of

7615
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:38,239
liberty

7617
02:13:36,079 --> 02:13:39,599
there's an artist that designed the

7619
02:13:38,239 --> 02:13:42,320
eiffel tower

7621
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:44,079
this is the reason why i donated 100

7623
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:47,119
million dollars to james terrell's

7625
02:13:44,079 --> 02:13:49,599
rodent crater uh uh

7627
02:13:47,119 --> 02:13:50,800
project when i went to this is like the

7629
02:13:49,599 --> 02:13:54,639
eighth

7631
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:57,520
wonder of the world but i saw spaces

7633
02:13:54,639 --> 02:13:58,159
that we can exist in that would be

7635
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:00,880
helpful

7637
02:13:58,159 --> 02:14:01,679
for our health our well-being these are

7639
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:04,719
healthier

7641
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:06,480
places for us to be we need to be like

7643
02:14:04,719 --> 02:14:08,000
almost like turalyon's like our our life

7645
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:09,679
is like a shakespearean

7647
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:11,119
uh like shakespeare has written 30

7649
02:14:09,679 --> 02:14:13,599
percent of uh

7651
02:14:11,119 --> 02:14:15,360
our language that we use like i say like

7653
02:14:13,599 --> 02:14:15,760
he must have been a really nice person

7655
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:17,440
like

7657
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:19,040
davinci used to walk away from people

7659
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:20,159
when he would talk to people and that's

7661
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:21,840
but that's the reason why it's the da

7663
02:14:20,159 --> 02:14:24,880
vinci code and at the da vinci

7665
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:26,000
life because he never was able to get it

7667
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:28,159
across to the

7669
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:29,599
to the to the level to affect us for

7671
02:14:28,159 --> 02:14:31,679
generations to come

7673
02:14:29,599 --> 02:14:33,119
these people love art but they want to

7675
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:35,040
put art in the box

7677
02:14:33,119 --> 02:14:36,719
we need to surround ourselves with the

7679
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:40,320
artist because the artists

7681
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:43,840
are the the most connected

7683
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:45,119
the most truthful and their dinosaur

7685
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:47,119
never got killed

7687
02:14:45,119 --> 02:14:48,159
somehow the people who have figured out

7689
02:14:47,119 --> 02:14:50,480
how to make a

7691
02:14:48,159 --> 02:14:52,840
real a living off of art is what do you

7693

7695
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:58,400
meaning art class

7697
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:59,440
would be considered to be fun like every

7699
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:01,440
kid loves to draw

7701
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:03,920

02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:31,920
these things these sharp edges these

7729
02:15:30,159 --> 02:15:33,119
corners these anxieties these fears

7731
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:35,679

consume right here

7737
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,800
that turn us old and make us brittle and

7739
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:42,719

7755
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:57,280
fearless the children

7757
02:15:55,599 --> 02:15:59,199
it's it's funny it's like claudio

7759
02:15:57,280 --> 02:16:00,239
sylvestre one of our lead architects i

7761
02:15:59,199 --> 02:16:02,880
worked with since

7763
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:04,079
uh age 24 he built this home in my

7765
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:07,520
oracle with john with john

7767
02:16:04,079 --> 02:16:10,000
paulson and he has like this golf

7769
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:10,719
course which it's in the acoustics are

7771
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,079
incredible

7773
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:14,400
but it's this part where you can walk

7775
02:16:12,079 --> 02:16:17,599
along that's 20 feet high

7777
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:18,719
and i said you know would you you know

7779
02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:19,920
what about the kids what

7781
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:21,440
you know you have a balcony you have a

7783
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:22,000
banister or something and he looked at

7785
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:25,119
me and said

7787
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:28,400
they're smarter than we think

7789
02:16:25,119 --> 02:16:29,199
wow and meaning like if we were never

7791
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:32,319
taught

7793
02:16:29,199 --> 02:16:35,280
the missing banister theory that

7795
02:16:32,319 --> 02:16:36,960
we could all tightrope walk the missing

7797
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:38,000
banister theory i wrote it in my book

7799
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:39,840
thank you and you're welcome that i

7801
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,280
wrote with my friend sakaya that's

7803
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:43,840
actually here right now that's uh

7805
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:46,000
uh that you were talking to earlier is

7807
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:49,120
look you could walk down a straight line

7809
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,479
without worrying about anything uh but

7811
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:51,920
you take that exact straight line and

7813
02:16:50,479 --> 02:16:53,840
put it 20 story high

7815
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:55,679
20 stories high you know i'm going with

7817
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:57,840
it yeah and you remove the balconies

7819
02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:59,599
you're going to be so concerned about

7821
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:01,040
the idea of falling that it will make

7823
02:16:59,599 --> 02:17:03,200
you fall yep

7825
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:04,479
and that's where the superpower is in

7827
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:06,719
removing the fear

7829
02:17:04,479 --> 02:17:07,599
yes that's a beautiful thing to say

7831
02:17:06,719 --> 02:17:09,200
right there

7833
02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:15,519
and it's also probably the first sound

7835
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:18,240
biteable thing that i've said the entire

7837
02:17:15,519 --> 02:17:19,920
all right let me talk to you about so

7839
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:20,639
we're serious here so let's talk about

7841
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:23,040
like real

7843
02:17:20,639 --> 02:17:24,080
presidential issues let's talk about

7845
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:26,319
like here's

7847
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:27,599
here's some things that just when we

7849
02:17:26,319 --> 02:17:29,040
talk about this country

7851
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:31,439
here's some things that are that mean a

7853
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:33,599
lot to me one student debt

7855
02:17:31,439 --> 02:17:35,280
i think it's crazy i think it's crazy

7857
02:17:33,599 --> 02:17:37,359
that we take children

7859
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:38,399
when they're 17 18 years old we send

7861
02:17:37,359 --> 02:17:39,920
them way to college

7863
02:17:38,399 --> 02:17:41,679
we make them literally hundreds of

7865
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:43,519
thousands of dollars in debt and then we

7867
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:46,399
ask them to go out into the world

7869
02:17:43,519 --> 02:17:47,840
and try to manage this money and and try

7871
02:17:46,399 --> 02:17:49,280
to get a job that's going to pay them a

7873
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:51,040
fraction of what they owe

7875
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:52,240
for their education i think it's crazy i

7877
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:53,519
think we should figure out a way to

7879
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:54,960
absolve student debt

7881
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:56,800
i think we should figure out a way to

7883
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:59,200
make education

7885
02:17:56,800 --> 02:18:00,719
at the very least far less expensive

7887
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:02,559
than it is now

7889
02:18:00,719 --> 02:18:05,200
this is this is a big issue for people

7891
02:18:02,559 --> 02:18:08,479
absolutely i'm i'm completely confident

7893
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:10,000
that i will figure out how to get

7895
02:18:08,479 --> 02:18:13,280
america out of debt

7897
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:15,679
that i have the ability once i see

7899
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:17,519
everything i never make the wrong

7901
02:18:15,679 --> 02:18:19,120
decision

7903
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:20,960
when i'm giving all the information

7905
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:21,840
that's my that's my skill set anything i

7907
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:25,760
go into

7909
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:29,200
producing rap homes

7911
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:30,240

i apply my taste and i have the best

7917
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:36,160
taste

7919
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:38,479
on the planet i mean quincy jones

7921
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:40,080
there's a couple people that's like

02:18:38,479 --> 02:18:41,519
okay crazy don't taste might be better

7925
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:42,880
than mine but if quincy could you

7927
02:18:41,519 --> 02:18:46,240
imagine quincy jones

7929
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:49,840
as a president i could yeah

7931
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:51,840
or uh walt disney uh steve jobs like

7933
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:54,000
maybe some of these personalities are a

7935
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:55,040
little volatile yeah yeah but that's how

7937
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:59,359
he gets things done

7939
02:18:55,040 --> 02:19:02,639
yeah like for america to be as

7941
02:18:59,359 --> 02:19:03,120
warming and inviting as as as disney

7943
02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:05,840
world

7945
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:07,200
there used to be you know this dream of

7947
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:08,000
you know people still have this dream of

7949
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:11,599
coming to them

7951
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:13,439
they're coming to america like it's

7953
02:19:11,599 --> 02:19:14,960
the america that i grew up even with

7955
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:17,280
like when ronald reagan

7957
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:18,559
was in office it's like he was hanging

7959
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:21,679
out with michael jackson

7961
02:19:18,559 --> 02:19:23,920
and you know it's like it felt america

7963
02:19:21,679 --> 02:19:25,920
plus the way the media showed things

7965
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:29,519
like the american dream

7967
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:31,840
was alive and well and

7969
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:34,000
even at the same time in in the ghetto

7971
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:37,280
it was a living hell and we were being

7973
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:38,559
you know given you know bricks were put

7975
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:40,160
on the street

7977
02:19:38,559 --> 02:19:41,599
uh bricks are pulled on the street doing

7979
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:42,240
the riots now bricks are putting on the

7981
02:19:41,599 --> 02:19:44,399
street

7983
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:46,240
in eighties a different kind of brick

7985
02:19:44,399 --> 02:19:48,319
and there were guns placed

7987
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:50,160
and the fathers were being taken out of

7989
02:19:48,319 --> 02:19:51,520
the hood and this is all this so don't

7991
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:54,560
let me say like

7993
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:56,960
everything was perfect doing that um

7995
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:58,880
doing that era but the perception right

7997
02:19:56,960 --> 02:19:59,280
now perception is more important than

7999
02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:02,720
it's

8001
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:06,080
ever than it's ever been like what we

8003
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:07,920
show you know it's just i mean it's

8005
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:10,880
outright

8007
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:12,160
it's it's just uh i don't even wanna i

8009
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:13,439
don't wanna i don't know i don't wanna

8011
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:15,040
dwell on it let's keep going into what

8013
02:20:13,439 --> 02:20:16,080
you're saying about the debt because

8015
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:18,240
also i don't have

8017
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:19,920
like if you ask me about covet i can

8019
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:21,439
only give you my perspective as a

8021
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:24,399
civilian

the bitcoin guys and these are guys that

8055
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:05,359
really have a perspective on what

8057
02:21:03,359 --> 02:21:06,800
the true liberation of america and

8059
02:21:05,359 --> 02:21:09,920
humanity will be

8061
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:12,000
these guys a lot of the the specifically

8063
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:14,880
these guys but a lot of the tech guys

8065
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:16,319
were able to use the new highways the

8067
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:18,960
new information highways

8069
02:21:16,319 --> 02:21:20,000
and create the next frontier of our

8071
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:23,040
existence

8073
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:26,080
while the powers of our

8075
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:29,359
uh political system are still

8077
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:32,640
anchoring on electoral college

8079
02:21:29,359 --> 02:21:33,680
which was based around slavery about the

8081
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:35,920
idea

8083
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:37,520
of slaves being three-fifths of man and

8085
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:41,680
get this

8087
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:44,319
it wasn't even created by pro slaves

8089
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:46,319
three-fifths of man was created by the

8091
02:21:44,319 --> 02:21:49,040
anti-slaves in the north

8093
02:21:46,319 --> 02:21:49,920
as a compromise and that basically

8095
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:51,920
explains

8097
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:53,200
the existence of black people in america

8099
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:55,840
to to this

8101
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:57,680
day the people that were on our side

8103
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:59,120
supposedly said we were three-fifths of

8105
02:21:57,680 --> 02:22:01,840
men

8107
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:02,319
the people that were on our side the

8109
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:04,880
people

8111
02:22:02,319 --> 02:22:06,399
on our side thought of us as

8113
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:09,520
three-fifths of man meaning like

8115
02:22:06,399 --> 02:22:10,720
yeah come work for us but you know

8117
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:12,640
you're three fifths of men sitting you

8119
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:14,880
have electoral college

8121
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:16,720
and gerrymandering happening to this

8123
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:19,760
date where if you have

8125
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:22,760
uh uh latinos uh

8127
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:24,560
uh blacks other minorities they're

8129
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:27,760
redrawing

8131
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:31,040
the lines to affect the vote

8133
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:32,720
to this day that does not relate to the

8135
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:34,640
information highway that we live in

8137
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:37,120
today that allow

8139
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:38,800
all these you know tech guys to become

8141
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:42,160
multi-billionaires and lead

8143
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:44,800
uh and and and and

8145
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:46,479
lead free thought or allow you know as

8147
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:46,960
best as we could a version of free

8149
02:22:46,479 --> 02:22:48,960
thought

8151
02:22:46,960 --> 02:22:50,479
i i know i gave you a symphony but you

8153
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:52,800
see how all this

8155
02:22:50,479 --> 02:22:53,680
really connects we're sticking you know

8157
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:55,200
why don't we just keep

8159
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:56,720
why don't we why don't we put the white

8161
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:58,160
wigs back on they still wear the white

8163
02:22:56,720 --> 02:23:00,000
wigs down uh

8165
02:22:58,160 --> 02:23:02,000
yeah england they still wear it you know

8167
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:05,040
that's the whole thing just because

8169
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:08,080
you know someone's not you know wearing

8171
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:10,560
uh uh uh a kkk

8173
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:12,160
uh uniform or a white wig doesn't mean

8175
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:15,520
that they aren't holding on

8177
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:18,800
to the very core of the

8179
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:19,120
the country being uh you know uh based

8181
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:21,439
on

8183
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:22,319
and built off of slavery so when

8185
02:23:21,439 --> 02:23:23,600
everyone's saying

8187
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:26,720
vote you know that's the reason why my

8189
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:30,080
mercy is vote kanye because like

8191
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:31,840
vote for who look man if you ain't gonna

8193
02:23:30,080 --> 02:23:33,840
say who you voting on out loud don't

8195
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:34,880
even wear the vote t-shirt that's so

8197
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:36,720
random

8199
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:38,560
right that's so rare and we always know

8201
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:40,479
voters like democrat and stuff because

8203
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:42,560
there's nobody is that trump that's like

8205
02:23:40,479 --> 02:23:44,800
wears a vote t-shirt isn't that funny

8207
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:45,680
but it's such a go ahead if you do say

8209
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:48,399
that yeah you say

8211
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:50,000
vote is mostly vote democrat like and if

8213
02:23:48,399 --> 02:23:52,479
you have an american flag

8215
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:53,359
mostly you're voting trump like these

8217
02:23:52,479 --> 02:23:54,800
are these are

8219
02:23:53,359 --> 02:23:56,960
realities that we've sort of accepted

8221
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:58,960
and it's subs it's all this subliminal

8223
02:23:56,960 --> 02:24:01,600
stuff that's that's based on like fear

8225
02:23:58,960 --> 02:24:02,720
and control even like this like this

8227
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:04,000
look at this

8229
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:07,120
the whole this is the three-fifths of

8231
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:07,120
man thing right okay

8233
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:14,479
the democrats were willing to take the

8235
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:17,439
chance of not

8237
02:24:14,479 --> 02:24:18,640
winning as long as the conglomerate

8239
02:24:17,439 --> 02:24:21,920
could be completely

8241
02:24:18,640 --> 02:24:24,080
in control of

8243
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:25,359
as completely in control you know what

8245
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:27,920
i'm saying that bernie

8247
02:24:25,359 --> 02:24:28,960
yeah bernie would have won he would have

8249
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:31,520
won this is something

8251
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:32,720
i wore a trumpet i'm saying like bernie

8253
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:35,680
is a superhero

8255
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:36,960
yeah you know and he would be the

8257
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:40,080
perfect

8259
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:42,080
the perfect and the perfect person to be

8261
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:44,479
the opposite of what trump represents

8263
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:46,240
yeah he's an anti-capitalist he's a is a

8265
02:24:44,479 --> 02:24:48,479
guy who's a social democrat

8267
02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:50,319
and you and but you know the problem

8269
02:24:48,479 --> 02:24:52,000
they couldn't control bernie

8271
02:24:50,319 --> 02:24:53,760
because you can't you can't control him

8273
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,399
he's been so consistent in his whole

8275
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:56,399
life

8277
02:24:54,399 --> 02:24:58,560
so so what i'm saying is they literally

8279
02:24:56,399 --> 02:24:59,200
kicked if this doesn't say something

8281
02:24:58,560 --> 02:25:01,280
it's like

8283
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:02,240
they kicked the superhero you know

8285
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:03,520
saying they they

8287
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:05,359
well they wanted control it's the same

8289
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:07,040
thing they did with tulsi gabbard but

8291
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:08,880
bernie was interesting because he's this

8293
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:11,520
democratic socialist because he's got

8295
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:13,359
these ideas that are scary to capitalism

8297
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:15,280
you know it's funny because i i created

8299
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:16,960
the birthday party which

8301
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:19,200
on the on the next selection what's

8303
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:21,680
going to happen is i mean you guys got

8305
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:23,120
300 million viewers you know after this

8307
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:25,359
it'll probably be 900 million because

8309
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:27,040
you know i run a stock up you know

8311
02:25:25,359 --> 02:25:29,600
you just do a little bit of bill cosby

8313
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:29,600
in that neck

8315
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:40,160
the uh no doubt jello pudding

8317
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:42,319
exactly exactly so uh

8319
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:43,840
so this is a long rant but i really

8321
02:25:42,319 --> 02:25:44,240
would like to talk to you about specific

8323
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:45,760
things

8325
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:47,600
okay i mean it was a beautiful long

8327
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:48,560
symphony but there's a there's a cap on

8329
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:50,399
it there's a pop

8331
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:53,439
we don't we don't we don't we don't want

8333
02:25:50,399 --> 02:25:53,439
to catch up

8335
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:07,520
but there's a possibility that i could

8337
02:26:04,840 --> 02:26:09,439
um it's actually technically possible

8339
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:11,920
for me to win

8341
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:13,040
now which would be the best option for

8343
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:16,560
america

8345
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:19,200
i would uh i'm i'm on uh 12 ballots

8347
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:20,479
and in 17 states that you could write me

8349
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:23,920
in on so if people

8351
02:26:20,479 --> 02:26:27,040
got up people that never voted uh got up

8353
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:28,080
registered voted for me they'd have to

8355
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:31,520
take it

8357
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:32,960
take it to the house because

8359
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:36,640
i would you know i could possibly win

8361
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:39,200
now i'm definitely 100 winning in 2024

8363
02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:40,640
and with that thought i was like okay i

8365
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:42,960
got the birthday party but i was

8367
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:42,960
thinking

8369
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:49,840
maybe there's a possibility i would be

8371
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:53,840
they said that wouldn't happen i was

8373
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:56,880
thinking i would you know

8375
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:58,160
possibly be the democrat you know i

8377
02:26:56,880 --> 02:26:58,800
don't think they would ever let you in

8379
02:26:58,160 --> 02:27:00,640
like that

8381
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:02,640
but i don't know maybe who knows what

8383
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:03,760
happens after this joe biden kamala

8385
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:05,520
harris thing

8387
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:08,800
who knows he knows what they think you

8389
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:11,040
know some you i would be the first

8391
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:11,040
i'm

8393
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:18,720
i'm trying i'm not trying to i'm one of

8395
02:27:16,479 --> 02:27:21,040
the

8397
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:21,040
first

8399

servants of christ uh since

8405
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:39,040
modern media has come to pass meaning

8407
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:40,960
when i when i when i talk i'm not

02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:59,200
but there's not some big plan or like

8421
02:27:56,720 --> 02:28:02,240
some practice script thing where it says

8423
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:04,720
you go in and you you say this

8425
02:28:02,240 --> 02:28:05,439
you you do this we we've got we want to

8427
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:09,359
keep

8429
02:28:05,439 --> 02:28:10,720
uh selling kodak film so we want to stop

8431
02:28:09,359 --> 02:28:12,479
you know you from bringing out the

8433
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:13,359
digital camera we want to keep you know

8435
02:28:12,479 --> 02:28:15,920
selling this

8437
02:28:13,359 --> 02:28:16,880
raising the price of gas so we're not

8439
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:19,040
going to look to

8441
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:20,640
how to like safely harness nuclear power

8443
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:22,560
or to do electric power

8445
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:24,720
okay go ahead ask another question i

8447
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:26,240
really just

8449
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:28,160
i quite love the sound of my own voice

8451
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:30,479
as you can see apparently uh

8453
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:32,560
it's okay so it's this microphone we

8455
02:28:30,479 --> 02:28:34,960
started it sounds great

8457
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:36,880
so we started with student debt and we

8459
02:28:34,960 --> 02:28:39,840
got we got on this long symphony

8461
02:28:36,880 --> 02:28:41,760
yeah um have you given thought into the

8463
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:43,920
idea of free education

8465
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:45,280
and particularly here's a big one for me

8467
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:47,120
as well free health care

8469
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:48,319
i think if we think of ourselves as a

8471
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:50,640
country and

8473
02:28:48,319 --> 02:28:51,520
our country as a community we're all a

8475
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:53,200
bunch of people

8477
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:55,359
that are together if we're going to take

8479
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:56,319
care of things like the fire department

8481
02:28:55,359 --> 02:28:59,200
if we're going to take care of things

8483
02:28:56,319 --> 02:29:01,040
like the police department education

8485
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:03,040
we've got to take care of health care we

8487
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:04,720
got we got to make it so that people get

8489
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:06,560
sick they don't go bankrupt

8491
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:08,080
we got to make it so that no one has to

8493
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:11,200
worry about being taken

8495
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:13,920
care of and i i and i don't mean

8497
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:16,000
to eliminate the ability for someone to

8499
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:16,880
hire a private specialist for surgery or

8501
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,720
anything like that

8503
02:29:16,880 --> 02:29:20,800
i'm not i'm not saying that but i'm

8505
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:21,520
saying at the very least we have to

8507
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:24,640
cover

8509
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:25,280
base medical concerns for the population

8511
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:28,319
it's just

8513
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:29,359
it's an a giant part of what what it is

8515
02:29:28,319 --> 02:29:31,680
to be a person

8517
02:29:29,359 --> 02:29:33,840
is to to worry about your your body

8519
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:35,760
being broken to worry about being sick

8521
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:37,280
to worry about what this is going to

8523
02:29:35,760 --> 02:29:38,479
cost your family financially and how it

8525
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:40,240
could ruin people

8527
02:29:38,479 --> 02:29:42,160
this is a i mean this is a huge issue in

8529
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:45,200
our country is

8531
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:45,760
medical health so have you thought about

8533
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:49,359
that

8535
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:50,880
absolutely i i hear you and i feel you

8537
02:29:49,359 --> 02:29:53,280
and i feel what people are going through

8539
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:56,880
i think that

8541
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:59,680
there is a it's not just

8543
02:29:56,880 --> 02:30:00,880
how we treat people there's preventative

8545
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:03,920
measures yes

8547
02:30:00,880 --> 02:30:05,200
that can help us from getting sick our

8549
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:08,880
our diet our

8551
02:30:05,200 --> 02:30:09,920
our locations are our the our our jobs

8553
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:12,960
there's a lot of that

8555
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:15,920
that affects us and puts us in those uh

8557
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:18,399
situation transportation you know like

8559
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:20,800
as you go into like autonomous uh

8561
02:30:18,399 --> 02:30:21,760
vehicles and tram systems like just kind

8563
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:24,720
of

8565
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:26,240
you know trains that are like uh

8567
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:28,880
floating malls or floating

8569
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:30,560
uh starbucks or something like movement

8571
02:30:28,880 --> 02:30:33,040
like designing

8573
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:34,000
our world to be the world of the future

8575
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:36,399
will

8577
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:38,640
uh will help us with health that's the

8579
02:30:36,399 --> 02:30:42,560
preventative message and then as far as

8581
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:46,160
uh being more inventive in the way we um

8583
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:49,359
we connect uh holistic uh

8585
02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:50,240
medicine with modern medicine i believe

8587
02:30:49,359 --> 02:30:53,920
in both

8589
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:57,520
medicines i believe in god i believe in

8591
02:30:53,920 --> 02:31:00,880
god and nature i believe

8593
02:30:57,520 --> 02:31:04,720
in uh science

8595
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:06,040
and physics and you know it's like

8597
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:08,880
the first simplest form of

8599
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:14,080
bioengineering uh

8601
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:18,080
i think is farming and to

8603
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:20,560
be able to have like i talk about the

8605
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:22,319
the guys at mit the greatest scientists

8607
02:31:20,560 --> 02:31:26,240
in the world there's people who

8609
02:31:22,319 --> 02:31:29,439
are that are like the elons

8611
02:31:26,240 --> 02:31:32,319
of the the medical field but perhaps

8613
02:31:29,439 --> 02:31:33,200
they're sitting there on the on on the

8615
02:31:32,319 --> 02:31:36,560
floors like

8617
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:38,720
serving on the front line fighting covet

8619
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:40,160
uh where you know they didn't have the

8621
02:31:38,720 --> 02:31:42,640
opportunity to

8623
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:43,840
create paypal and become a billionaire

8625
02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:46,080
and go to the

8627
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:47,520
next idea or when they present it and

8629
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:49,840
want people to invest

8631
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:52,080
in these inventions that they have they

8633
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:54,000
haven't had the voice of the platform

8635
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:55,359
to bring this invention there's cures to

8637
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,080
things like one of the things is the

8639
02:31:55,359 --> 02:31:57,439
silver bullet

8641
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:58,800
like what what i went through with the

8643
02:31:57,439 --> 02:31:59,840
medication when they gave me the

8645
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:02,000
medication

8647
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:03,040
that made me fat but then they said okay

8649
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,840
we have one

8651
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:07,520
that doesn't we we all know what a

8653
02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:10,479
silver bullet is in medication right

8655
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:12,080
so it's the um it's a medication that

8657
02:32:10,479 --> 02:32:13,040
goes and just kills exactly what it's

8659
02:32:12,080 --> 02:32:16,800
supposed to kill

8661
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:19,200
but for capitalism

8663
02:32:16,800 --> 02:32:21,280
that's not the best medication to

8665
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:23,680
actually cure people

8667
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:25,040
capitalists want to keep people they

8669
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:26,080
want to treat them they want to treat

8671
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:27,760
they want to keep you sick

8673
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:29,600
because that's how you you keep making

8675
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:31,200
money to have a guy

8677
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:32,880
like for me when i say i put my life on

8679
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:33,760
the line i think about abraham lincoln i

8681
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:37,280
think about

8683
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:39,680
jfk to go in and sit and say

8685
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:41,439
you know the whole thing is no everyone

8687
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:42,160
is going to be more prosperous i think

8689
02:32:41,439 --> 02:32:44,479
is the word

8691
02:32:42,160 --> 02:32:45,760
not specifically are you going to 5x

8693
02:32:44,479 --> 02:32:48,160
your money everyone's like

8695
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:49,359
trying to get no it's about prosperity

8697
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:52,640
and to be able to

8699
02:32:49,359 --> 02:32:55,760
really have real conversations with

8701
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:58,960
the lead heads of like big pharm

8703
02:32:55,760 --> 02:33:02,720
and real conversations with the heads of

8705
02:32:58,960 --> 02:33:04,800
uh of of uh holistic

8707
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:06,880
and and natural healing to put these

8709
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:07,359
people in a room together people aren't

8711
02:33:06,880 --> 02:33:09,040
even having

8713
02:33:07,359 --> 02:33:10,640
they're mad at each other they're afraid

8715
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:13,760
of each other uh

8717
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:14,800
i i i donated to a christian school in

8719
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:17,920
cody

8721
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:20,319
and um i also

8723
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:21,120
went by and saw this other amazing

8725
02:33:20,319 --> 02:33:24,240
school

8727
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:26,960
in uh in cody where they have

8729
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:28,720
uh autistic children and kids with

8731
02:33:26,960 --> 02:33:31,760
special needs in the same

8733
02:33:28,720 --> 02:33:35,280
classrooms as uh

8735
02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:37,439
other as regular kids and

8737
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:38,800
i just saw this juxtaposition and the

8739
02:33:37,439 --> 02:33:42,640
head of that that

8741
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:45,600
school is uh a christian but

8743
02:33:42,640 --> 02:33:47,920
it's a state school so there's no prayer

8745
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:49,200
in the school and then the other school

8747
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:50,720
is fully christian

8749
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:52,960
but it's not a state school so they

8751
02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:56,160
don't have money in the school

8753
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:59,520
and i wanted to have dinner with

8755
02:33:56,160 --> 02:34:01,439
uh both of the principals come to find

8757
02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:04,160
out

8759
02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:04,960
the principal and these guys they talk

8761
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:08,479
maybe at a

8763
02:34:04,960 --> 02:34:12,000
softball game or something the principal

8765
02:34:08,479 --> 02:34:13,840
house is one block walking distance

8767
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:15,600
the principle of one schools houses one

8769
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:16,000
block walking distance from the school

8771
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:19,200
or the other

8773
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:22,319
principal that we're this close

8775
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:24,319
right now we have the solutions but we

8777
02:34:22,319 --> 02:34:26,240
all have our backs to each other

8779
02:34:24,319 --> 02:34:27,680
we need to face each other and like how

8781
02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:29,920
we're facing each other right now

8783
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:31,040
and have these conversations the

8785
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:34,160
solutions for

8787
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:35,600
utopia are in front of us but what's

8789
02:34:34,160 --> 02:34:39,040
holding us back

8791
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:40,640
fear people are sitting on their money

8793
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:42,240
really they're sitting under their money

8795
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:45,840
i know i'm gonna give you a thing okay

8797
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:45,840
that's it next one

8799
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:50,160
did you get did you get my perspective

8801
02:34:48,319 --> 02:34:51,920
of the real the way i would approach

8803
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:53,200
you would bring people together to

8805
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:55,040
communicate and try to figure out a

8807
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:57,280
better strategy for health care

8809
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:59,280
yeah i mean and and in reality some

8811
02:34:57,280 --> 02:35:04,640
financial realities that have to be

8813
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:06,399
in london when you go to the hospital

8815
02:35:04,640 --> 02:35:07,840
no let me give you the american example

8817
02:35:06,399 --> 02:35:09,520
when i go to the hospital i had

8819
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:12,399
something wrong on my foot

8821
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:13,200
three years ago they asked me you know

8823
02:35:12,399 --> 02:35:16,319
do you want to take

8825
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:19,280
something do you want a pill i said no

8827
02:35:16,319 --> 02:35:20,000
five doctors and nurses ask me if i want

8829
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:21,520
a pill

8831
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:23,200
this is like worse than when you don't

8833
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:24,880
accept water on the plane and they just

8835
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:26,160
keep like do you want some more water

8837
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:27,680
i'll take the water all right because i

8839
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:29,040
don't want to be responsible for the

8841
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:30,560
water like when the plane takes off and

8843
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:31,120
it goes like this and i gotta like hold

8845
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:35,920
it in my

8847
02:35:31,120 --> 02:35:35,920
i don't want no water like i don't

8849
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:40,800
even know my like masseuse said i should

8851
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:43,840
drink more water uh

8853
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:46,240
so the so they

8855
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:48,080
they there are like people they have

8857
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:49,280
christmas parties about bonuses about

8859
02:35:48,080 --> 02:35:52,000
giving out more

8861
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:52,399
medication so we talk about they do look

8863
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,880
at this

8865
02:35:52,399 --> 02:35:56,319
how much does the earth cost exactly

8867
02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:58,080
there's no price on it right

8869
02:35:56,319 --> 02:36:00,640
we make money money's not even backed by

8871
02:35:58,080 --> 02:36:03,439
gold anymore so

8873
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:04,319
it's engineering it's where the budgets

8875
02:36:03,439 --> 02:36:06,800
are going

8877
02:36:04,319 --> 02:36:08,800
and like it was the best part on uh one

8879
02:36:06,800 --> 02:36:11,840
of the best parts on the sixth sense

8881
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:13,280
is when um

8883
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:14,960
when they looked at this video and it

8885
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:16,560
was a nanny

8887
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:18,160
uh they saw that the nanny was like

8889
02:36:16,560 --> 02:36:19,359
putting stuff in like the porch for the

8891
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:22,160
child that had passed

8893
02:36:19,359 --> 02:36:23,280
and he and then they said the ladies

8895
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:25,120
looked at the nanny and said you were

8897
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:29,600
keeping her sick

8899
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:33,359
you're keeping her sick like we are sick

8901
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:37,600
we are sick uh abortion culture

8903
02:36:33,359 --> 02:36:40,560
sex culture uh capitalism we are sick

8905
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:42,560
we as a people as a not just the

8907
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:45,920
american society of the world we are

8909
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:46,240
sick and we are keeping ourselves sick

8911
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:48,560
we're

8913
02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:50,800
all responsible like the black mirror

8915
02:36:48,560 --> 02:36:53,760
episode we're all responsible

8917
02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:54,800
in some way we all play some part like

8919
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:58,160
if i go to

8921
02:36:54,800 --> 02:37:02,160
pornhub in the very next thing

8923
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:04,080
um and i uh and like backslide and do

8925
02:37:02,160 --> 02:37:05,920
this because i struggle with this since

8927
02:37:04,080 --> 02:37:08,319
i was like five years old right

8929
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:09,200
and the very next thing says something

8931
02:37:08,319 --> 02:37:12,479
about

8933
02:37:09,200 --> 02:37:14,479
like trafficking

8935
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:16,319
then i literally would have to like put

8937
02:37:14,479 --> 02:37:18,479
my hand over that part

8939
02:37:16,319 --> 02:37:20,080
and like click the thing i'm going to

8941
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:22,479
and thinking that like i'm not

8943
02:37:20,080 --> 02:37:23,200
a part of the the bigger conglomerate

8945
02:37:22,479 --> 02:37:25,120
that we're all

8947
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:26,720
oh i'm not really a part of the main

8949
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:28,000
problem because i'm i'm not as bad as

8951
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:29,120
that guy and i'm not looking at this

8953
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:32,000
part and i'm not like

8955
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:33,520
we all play a part of it then we're all

8957
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,720
sick in some way and the world has been

8959
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:38,160
designed to keep

8961
02:37:34,720 --> 02:37:41,520
us sick like spatial

8963
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:44,960
engineering based off faith

8965
02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:47,760
can save a world literally like building

8967
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:49,120
will save the world spatial engineering

8969
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:51,439
like

8971
02:37:49,120 --> 02:37:53,520
engineering not going to space

8973
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:54,640
engineering our spaces the amount of

8975
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:56,319
space that we need

8977
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:58,560
the way that we interact with each other

8979
02:37:56,319 --> 02:38:00,319
how close we are to our loved ones

8981
02:37:58,560 --> 02:38:02,000
our families how close we are to our

8983
02:38:00,319 --> 02:38:02,800
jobs we got to experience a lot of this

8985
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,880
some people

8987
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:06,960
it wasn't good some people it's better

8989
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:09,040
they were connected with their children

8991
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:10,640
and their families in a whole different

8993
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:13,120
way like we're talking

8995
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:14,560
this is my thing we could talk about all

8997
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:18,080
of these important

8999
02:38:14,560 --> 02:38:20,240
current issues there's

9001
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:22,399
deeper reasons based on the slave

9003
02:38:20,240 --> 02:38:24,720
mentality based on fear

9005
02:38:22,399 --> 02:38:26,479
based on protectionism not specifically

9007
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:28,640
white supremacy and racism

9009
02:38:26,479 --> 02:38:30,720
protectionism people just want to

9011
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:31,200
protect what they have and there's this

9013
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:34,160
like

9015
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:34,640
photograph where you're holding um the

9017
02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:36,319
guys

9019
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:38,560
the little girls holding a teddy bear

9021
02:38:36,319 --> 02:38:42,560
and jesus has a giant teddy bear

9023
02:38:38,560 --> 02:38:44,479
behind her um her back

9025
02:38:42,560 --> 02:38:46,240
i mean behind his back she don't want to

9027
02:38:44,479 --> 02:38:48,319
give up the small teddy bear

9029
02:38:46,240 --> 02:38:49,439
for the bigger teddy bear that jesus has

9031
02:38:48,319 --> 02:38:52,960
waiting for her

9033
02:38:49,439 --> 02:38:56,399
there is prosperity for all families

9035
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:59,760
here on earth right now in service

9037
02:38:56,399 --> 02:39:01,359
to god there's happiness there's joy

9039
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:04,080
it's not a possibility it's a

9041
02:39:01,359 --> 02:39:06,479
probability just the fact that god

9043
02:39:04,080 --> 02:39:08,319
woke me up got me here safely and

9045
02:39:06,479 --> 02:39:11,600
allowed me to talk to you

9047
02:39:08,319 --> 02:39:13,520
right now and spark the minds

9049
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:14,880
of the people that are anointed to

9051
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:17,600
change the world

9053
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:18,800
is already what god wanted me to do if i

9055
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:21,200
didn't take a breath

9057
02:39:18,800 --> 02:39:22,479
after this point god had me here for

9059
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:24,720
this conversation

9061
02:39:22,479 --> 02:39:26,319
right now but i think god has more for

9063
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:27,600
me playing i don't think they gonna come

9065
02:39:26,319 --> 02:39:29,359
for me until he done

9067
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:30,880
until he done with me they ain't gonna

9069
02:39:29,359 --> 02:39:32,080
come for me until they done with me

9071
02:39:30,880 --> 02:39:33,600
i want to make it so if someone wanted

9073
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:33,960
to sample and put in a beat it'd be like

9075
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:38,000
perfect

9077
02:39:33,960 --> 02:39:39,280
[Laughter]

9079
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,359
they ain't gonna come they ain't gonna

9081
02:39:39,280 --> 02:39:42,800
come for me until they done with me they

9083
02:39:41,359 --> 02:39:45,040
ain't gonna come for me until he done

9085
02:39:42,800 --> 02:39:45,040
with me

9087
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:49,359
uh yeah yeah yeah help yourself you're

9089
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:51,760
always creating

9091
02:39:49,359 --> 02:39:53,040
now yeah but do you understand what i'm

9093
02:39:51,760 --> 02:39:54,960
saying

9095
02:39:53,040 --> 02:39:56,960
okay tell me what i'm saying what you're

9097
02:39:54,960 --> 02:40:00,720
saying is that

9099
02:39:56,960 --> 02:40:03,280
it's it's your overall philosophy

9101
02:40:00,720 --> 02:40:04,640
the way you're approaching life you're

9103
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:07,760
approaching life that there

9105
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:09,680
is good for everyone if we

9107
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:11,600
if we all work together if we all work

9109
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:12,560
together in the spirit of the way you

9111
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:15,600
think

9113
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:18,399
the spirit of god that will

9115
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:19,520
not not approach this like with a famine

9117
02:40:18,399 --> 02:40:21,200
mentality

9119
02:40:19,520 --> 02:40:22,960
but approach this like there's enough

9121
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:24,720
for everybody there's an abundance if we

9123
02:40:22,960 --> 02:40:26,720
if we engineer it correctly

9125
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:28,160
if we think about it correctly if we all

9127
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:30,479
come together with the spirit of

9129
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:32,479
everybody helping everybody this is the

9131
02:40:30,479 --> 02:40:34,399
spirit of christianity this is

9133
02:40:32,479 --> 02:40:36,720
the good spirit of christianity not the

9135
02:40:34,399 --> 02:40:39,279
christianity that gets despised or

9137
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:40,960
disparaged or you know evangelists

9139
02:40:39,279 --> 02:40:43,680
driving around in private jets

9141
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:44,880
the the spirit of of goodness and

9143
02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:45,680
treating each other like brothers and

9145
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:47,600
sisters

9147
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:48,800
yes but this can be done on a national

9149
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:51,040
scale yes

9151
02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:53,120
because those evangelists or the people

9153
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:54,720
who who spread the word of god

9155
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:56,479
you know there's people who are praying

9157
02:40:54,720 --> 02:40:57,040
for me you know we're praying like i

9159
02:40:56,479 --> 02:41:00,080
said

9161
02:40:57,040 --> 02:41:03,439
i like to okay yes i

9163
02:41:00,080 --> 02:41:06,640
am a genius but one of my most genius

9165
02:41:03,439 --> 02:41:08,800
skill sets is recognizing other geniuses

9167
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:10,479
and empowering them and giving them the

9169
02:41:08,800 --> 02:41:12,800
platform so the people that have been

9171
02:41:10,479 --> 02:41:15,439
praying for me this whole time

9173
02:41:12,800 --> 02:41:16,000
you know for jay to work for the kingdom

9175
02:41:15,439 --> 02:41:18,000
look at me

9177
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:20,479
look at me right here working from the

9179
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:22,319
kingdom that not leaning on my ego

9181
02:41:20,479 --> 02:41:24,319
not leaning on anything but leaning on

9183
02:41:22,319 --> 02:41:26,399
god in this situation saying

9185
02:41:24,319 --> 02:41:28,160
let's you know let's rise up together

9187
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:31,040
and show people what it's like

9189
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:31,760
to be christ like yeah we fall short you

9191
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:33,040
know i mean

9193
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:35,040
people love to like look at the

9195
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:37,200
christians that are the least

9197
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:38,960
christ-like to judge christianity

9199
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:40,720
as a whole well a lot of people got

9201
02:41:38,960 --> 02:41:43,200
jordans in 23 years old and

9203
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:45,040
don't very few of them play like lebron

9205
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:47,520
you know they want to be like

9207
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:48,800
like mike but there's very few people

9209
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:51,279
that get that close

9211
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:52,160
you know it's like yeah yeah what you're

9213
02:41:51,279 --> 02:41:54,399
saying is beautiful

9215
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:55,359
yeah that they do judge the people that

9217
02:41:54,399 --> 02:41:58,560
fail

9219
02:41:55,359 --> 02:42:01,920
people always go to the furthest extent

9221
02:41:58,560 --> 02:42:02,560
like if you talk about uh abortion

9223
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:05,040
culture

9225
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:05,600
people immediately go to rape but don't

9227
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:08,399
do

9229
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:09,359
the math on what percentage that is and

9231
02:42:08,399 --> 02:42:12,880
for me as a

9233
02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:15,200
as a christian president

9235
02:42:12,880 --> 02:42:16,319
you know as i said i go on that i

9237
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:18,880
touched on him before

9239
02:42:16,319 --> 02:42:19,840
i realize we're in an imperfect world

9241
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:22,800
you know when i

9243
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:24,000
talk to uh my fellow christians and we

9245
02:42:22,800 --> 02:42:26,640
talk about meat

9247
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:27,760
we talk about guns we talk about in this

9249
02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:30,160
imperfect world

9251
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:31,359
there's a transition between where we

9253
02:42:30,160 --> 02:42:33,680
are today

9255
02:42:31,359 --> 02:42:35,279
and where we're going does yeah does the

9257
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:38,479
meat industry have a

9259
02:42:35,279 --> 02:42:42,560
great impact on uh

9261
02:42:38,479 --> 02:42:45,040
the ozone i from what i hear it does

9263
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:46,560
and we have to transition one of the

9265
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:47,760
things i wanted

9267
02:42:46,560 --> 02:42:49,439
it's a thought that came in and thank

9269
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:50,479
you for allowing me to give you the

9271
02:42:49,439 --> 02:42:52,479
thoughts that are

9273
02:42:50,479 --> 02:42:54,319
coming into my head as opposed to trying

9275
02:42:52,479 --> 02:42:54,720
to put me on a grid because i'm off the

9277
02:42:54,319 --> 02:42:57,120
grid

9279
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:58,160
period the way i think clearly i paint

9281
02:42:57,120 --> 02:43:00,880
in circles

9283
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:01,920
you know i don't i don't paint inside of

9285
02:43:00,880 --> 02:43:03,760
the lines right

9287
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:05,279
so i was thinking about i forget the

9289
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:07,279
lady's name starts with a t

9291
02:43:05,279 --> 02:43:09,040
but she changed the meat industry

9293
02:43:07,279 --> 02:43:10,720
because she was hsp like highly

9295
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:13,680
sensitive person that's uh

9297
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:14,880
and put the uh the cows in a in round

9299
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:18,399
bins

9301
02:43:14,880 --> 02:43:19,680
and uh that's what i'm doing when i say

9303
02:43:18,399 --> 02:43:20,399
spatial engineering that's what i'm

9305
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:22,720
doing

9307
02:43:20,399 --> 02:43:23,920
with our spaces that i'm designing with

9309
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:27,520
the farms

9311
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:29,760
and uh with the school systems

9313
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:31,520
the unlearned systems the what are the

9315
02:43:29,760 --> 02:43:33,840
things that you're going to need

9317
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:35,359
you know in the future because 30 years

9319
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:37,040
we don't we don't even know we think

9321
02:43:35,359 --> 02:43:38,960
probably the things that we're learning

9323
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:41,120
in school right now won't even apply

9325
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:42,479
to people when they're 30 years old that

9327
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:44,560
are learning this stuff

9329
02:43:42,479 --> 02:43:46,000
you know age especially with technology

9331
02:43:44,560 --> 02:43:49,520
especially with technology and the

9333
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:49,520
people who design the curriculums

9335
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:57,120
way before technology yeah so

9337
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:58,240
i mean i was in computer programming

9339
02:43:57,120 --> 02:44:01,680
when i was uh

9341
02:43:58,240 --> 02:44:03,279
uh eight years old and i used to

9343
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:04,800
know how to program this how i got into

9345
02:44:03,279 --> 02:44:07,359
music in seventh grade i had a

9347
02:44:04,800 --> 02:44:08,640
amiga computer that had 4096 colors

9349
02:44:07,359 --> 02:44:10,560
that's why i got that one

9351
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:11,920
uh and i would program the different

9353
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:13,680
sprites and

9355
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:14,960
uh draw out each of the characters and

9357
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:16,319
animate them and i thought that was the

9359
02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:17,680
next frontier to like and because i

9361
02:44:16,319 --> 02:44:18,560
would do like animation books i wanted

9363
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:21,680
to be a

9365
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:23,520
animator and then i started doing the

9367
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:25,040
the music they had a music program on do

9369
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:26,640
the music for the video games

9371
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:28,319
and then i found myself running home

9373
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:29,760
from school all the way from 95th street

9375
02:44:28,319 --> 02:44:31,920
to 119th street

9377
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:33,840
to go and just keep programming the

9379
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:36,880
music so this is like third

9381
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:38,640
age you know 12 13

9383
02:44:36,880 --> 02:44:40,640
you know programming video games and

9385
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:43,279
that being the gateway into

9387
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:44,560
programming music i got a longer story

9389
02:44:43,279 --> 02:44:47,279
about that but i know you want to ask me

9391
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:51,840
some more serious stuff so um

9393
02:44:47,279 --> 02:44:54,960
ding okay this is a big one

9395
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:57,120
the military um if you

9397
02:44:54,960 --> 02:44:59,520
really did become president when excuse

9399
02:44:57,120 --> 02:45:01,120
me when you do become president

9401
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:02,800
you're going to have to deal with

9403
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:04,160
hostile governments

9405
02:45:02,800 --> 02:45:06,160
you're going to have to deal with

9407
02:45:04,160 --> 02:45:09,279
hostile militaries

9409
02:45:06,160 --> 02:45:11,359
and dictators you know people

9411
02:45:09,279 --> 02:45:13,359
in another country that in other

9413
02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:14,080
countries that don't have a value of

9415
02:45:13,359 --> 02:45:17,279
human life

9417
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:19,439
and throughout history we've had

9419
02:45:17,279 --> 02:45:21,040
immense problems because of that because

9421
02:45:19,439 --> 02:45:24,720
of military conflicts

9423
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:24,720
how do you think you will approach that

9425
02:45:25,279 --> 02:45:27,439
i mean you will be the

9427
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,800
commander-in-chief of the greatest army

9429
02:45:27,439 --> 02:45:30,720
the world has ever known

9431
02:45:28,800 --> 02:45:32,560
if you're in that position and we have

9433
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:34,319
to deal with some sort of a

9435
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:36,080
military action with china what if china

9437
02:45:34,319 --> 02:45:39,200
takes over taiwan

9439
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:41,760
what if they invade taiwan

9441
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:43,200
what if something happens with syria

9443
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:45,359
what if something happens with

9445
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:46,319
iran what if something happens with

9447
02:45:45,359 --> 02:45:49,359
russia

9449
02:45:46,319 --> 02:45:52,080
and you have to make decisions about

9451
02:45:49,359 --> 02:45:56,080
military action

9453
02:45:52,080 --> 02:45:58,720
have you thought about this

9455
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:58,720
yes i would

9457
02:46:04,960 --> 02:46:09,520
i have to say again like covet i'm a

9459
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:10,720
civilian

9461
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:12,640
and people could have all their

9463
02:46:10,720 --> 02:46:14,080
perspectives that they could have of

9465
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:16,800
what they would do

9467
02:46:14,080 --> 02:46:18,080
in that situation but i would have the

9469
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:21,040
greatest professionals

9471
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:22,240
on the planet the most skilled people

9473
02:46:21,040 --> 02:46:24,000
that have all the

9475
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:26,080
experience that would present the

9477
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:29,439
information and i would make

9479
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:33,520
the most sound rational decisions

9481
02:46:29,439 --> 02:46:39,840
and i would follow god's

9483
02:46:33,520 --> 02:46:39,840
will in my approach

9485
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:43,279
to

9487
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:48,319
to dealing with these other countries to

9489
02:46:46,479 --> 02:46:52,800
dealing with these other leaders

9491
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:56,880
there's there's something about you know

9493
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:58,399
our president's personality and

9495
02:46:56,880 --> 02:47:01,840
the the leader of north korea's

9497
02:46:58,399 --> 02:47:05,439
personality where there's

9499
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:07,040
there's a level of common respect and

9501
02:47:05,439 --> 02:47:08,479
and that's the reason why they were able

9503
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:11,520
to talk and

9505
02:47:08,479 --> 02:47:16,240
we we the fear had been taken

9507
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:20,319
off of us like people who are

9509
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:24,479
uh god-fearing

9511
02:47:20,319 --> 02:47:29,520
self-made uh servants

9513
02:47:24,479 --> 02:47:33,680
of their people

9515
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:36,880
these these other you know scary

9517
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:41,120
dictators they feel like they're that

9519
02:47:36,880 --> 02:47:41,120
for their country and if they see

9521
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:49,359
a president that they know is just

9523
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:50,880
taking a check or part of a bigger

9525
02:47:49,359 --> 02:47:52,479
conglomerate now i don't want it like i

9527
02:47:50,880 --> 02:47:57,840
said i want to denounce

9529
02:47:52,479 --> 02:48:00,160
any of the uh uh candidates

9531
02:47:57,840 --> 02:48:00,160
then

9533
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:08,880
it's it's very it's very transactional

9535
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:08,880
it's um

9537
02:48:14,840 --> 02:48:17,840
and

9539
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:27,439
i just said a prayer in this situation

9541
02:48:26,560 --> 02:48:30,240
this isn't

9543
02:48:27,439 --> 02:48:31,359
you said a prayer because of what what

9545
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:32,720
what what

9547
02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:34,880
motivated you to say a prayer right

9549
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:34,880
there

9551
02:48:35,520 --> 02:48:39,120

subject yeah absolutely

9555
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:42,800

02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:46,160
you know joking about people's lives

9561
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:51,600
right we have to

9563
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:54,720
completely be still in this moment

9565
02:48:51,600 --> 02:48:59,359
allow god to guide our steps

9567
02:48:54,720 --> 02:49:01,520
and ask the right questions

9569
02:48:59,359 --> 02:49:04,000
with the highest ranking officials

9571
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:04,000
possible

9573
02:49:04,080 --> 02:49:08,479
this isn't something that you just wing

9575
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:11,279
or that you just come in

9577
02:49:08,479 --> 02:49:12,160
and say i did a bit of research i got

9579
02:49:11,279 --> 02:49:14,720

than what this whole

9593
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:32,720
uh interview has has been about

in in

9605
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:47,120
in in chicago and the the people the

9607
02:49:46,240 --> 02:49:51,040
people who have been

9609
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:54,399
harmed by police and the police like

9611
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:56,560
this all is going to take

9613
02:49:54,399 --> 02:49:58,160
serious time like time is love it's

9615
02:49:56,560 --> 02:50:00,319
going to take that love and that time

9617
02:49:58,160 --> 02:50:02,160
and

9619
02:50:00,319 --> 02:50:03,920
moments of listening moments of

9621
02:50:02,160 --> 02:50:05,279
understanding moments like when my wife

9623
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:08,080
goes and visits

9625
02:50:05,279 --> 02:50:08,880
people in prison and she hears their

9627
02:50:08,080 --> 02:50:12,479
stories

9629
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:16,080
she says i understand i understand

9631
02:50:12,479 --> 02:50:17,439
why you're into in

9633
02:50:16,080 --> 02:50:18,479
why you're in that situation i would

9635
02:50:17,439 --> 02:50:20,160
have did the same thing in this

9637
02:50:18,479 --> 02:50:22,160
situation

9639
02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:23,840
and for us to go to foreign countries

9641
02:50:22,160 --> 02:50:26,720
and really

9643
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:29,040
understand why that they're you know

9645
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:32,080
that they're in these situations

9647
02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:33,200
or why the killing has gone for so long

9649
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:35,439
or why the hate

9651
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:37,200
has gone so long and why the pain just

9653
02:50:35,439 --> 02:50:41,840
keeps on

9655
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:41,840
you know compounding and compacting

9657
02:50:43,279 --> 02:50:47,439
there's the empathy that i just have as

9659
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:50,560
an artist

9661
02:50:47,439 --> 02:50:53,680
that it doesn't become a two plus two

9663
02:50:50,560 --> 02:50:54,160
equals four situation my dad was

9665
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:57,760
actually

9667
02:50:54,160 --> 02:51:01,200
a a a psychology major

9669
02:50:57,760 --> 02:51:05,520
and a christian uh therapist

9671
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:08,720
and this therapy we talk about therapy

9673
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:08,720
period it's like

9675
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:14,399
we need healing internationally not just

9677
02:51:12,319 --> 02:51:15,240
selfishly for america america is number

9679
02:51:14,399 --> 02:51:19,120
one

9681
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:21,439
internationally we need healing

9683
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:21,439
and

9685
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:33,840
i would lead i would

9687
02:51:27,359 --> 02:51:33,840
i would lead with with love

9689
02:51:34,080 --> 02:51:39,200
dignity the responsibility to our

9691
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:44,160
country

9693
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:44,160
the coverage of our families of our

9695
02:51:44,840 --> 02:51:47,840
soldiers

9697
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:53,520
and in full service to god and to the

9699
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:53,520
american people

9701
02:51:57,920 --> 02:52:05,520
it's the there's a mode

9703
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:08,479
that i would be in in that position like

9705
02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:10,720
when i was a producer and i was a really

9707
02:52:08,479 --> 02:52:13,760
young man

9709
02:52:10,720 --> 02:52:13,760
i was running around

9711
02:52:13,840 --> 02:52:17,040
hopping on trains or

9713
02:52:17,840 --> 02:52:21,439
you know hopping turn styles and stuff

9715
02:52:19,520 --> 02:52:23,439
and like stealing from

9717
02:52:21,439 --> 02:52:25,600
cars and i mean not stealing cars but

9719
02:52:23,439 --> 02:52:30,399
stealing clothes from stores and

9721
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:34,080
um then i was

9723
02:52:30,399 --> 02:52:34,880
selling music and uh you know going and

9725
02:52:34,080 --> 02:52:36,720
buying

9727
02:52:34,880 --> 02:52:38,319
leather jackets and stuff then you know

9729
02:52:36,720 --> 02:52:39,279
dating a whole bunch of girls going on

9731
02:52:38,319 --> 02:52:43,200
tour

9733
02:52:39,279 --> 02:52:46,560
and then i had a family and

9735
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:50,479
i had to adjust a lot of my mentality

9737
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:53,920
and behavior to grow and be the man

9739
02:52:50,479 --> 02:52:57,520
that i needed to be then god called me

9741
02:52:53,920 --> 02:52:59,520
and i gave my life to christ

9743
02:52:57,520 --> 02:53:01,920
and god is helping me to be the

9745
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:04,560
christian that i need to be

9747
02:53:01,920 --> 02:53:06,080
and when it's in god's will that i

9749
02:53:04,560 --> 02:53:08,080
become the leader

9751
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:09,439
i will become the leader that i need to

9753
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:12,399
be

9755
02:53:09,439 --> 02:53:13,680
so right now as i said i'm a civilian

9757
02:53:12,399 --> 02:53:17,359
but

9759
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:20,720
my heart my mind and my spirit

9761
02:53:17,359 --> 02:53:21,200
is in a place where i feel i know that

9763
02:53:20,720 --> 02:53:24,399
i'm being

9765
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:27,760
i'm being called to captain this ship

9767
02:53:24,399 --> 02:53:29,040
like when roosevelt went in america was

9769
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:30,479
in shambles

9771
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:32,720
when i when i'd say those things about

9773
02:53:30,479 --> 02:53:33,200
those numbers when i went to adidas when

9775
02:53:32,720 --> 02:53:37,040
i went to

9777
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:39,680
gap like i'm the person

9779
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:41,279
that you actually call when things are

9781
02:53:39,680 --> 02:53:42,960
not going so well

9783
02:53:41,279 --> 02:53:44,560
you know you have that the mob movies is

9785
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:46,399
the guy that goes cleans up everything

9787
02:53:44,560 --> 02:53:49,520
and like puts everything

9789
02:53:46,399 --> 02:53:50,800
i'm i'm like the forensic where in the

9791
02:53:49,520 --> 02:53:53,760
same way how

9793
02:53:50,800 --> 02:53:54,479
you saw my mind touch on ten things at a

9795
02:53:53,760 --> 02:53:56,319
time

9797
02:53:54,479 --> 02:53:57,760
and then i had to say ten sentences at a

9799
02:53:56,319 --> 02:54:00,479
time if i could say them or maybe narrow

9801
02:53:57,760 --> 02:54:00,479
them down to seven

9803
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:03,840
that's the way my mind takes you know

9805
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:05,840
information

9807
02:54:03,840 --> 02:54:07,359
in and then it synthesizes it and it

9809
02:54:05,840 --> 02:54:08,880
comes out as a song or comes out as a

9811
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:12,880
product

9813
02:54:08,880 --> 02:54:16,160
using that mentality as a leader

9815
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:19,279
fearless god-fearing we

9817
02:54:16,160 --> 02:54:22,399
will heal we will show the world what

9819
02:54:19,279 --> 02:54:25,600
america should be

9821
02:54:22,399 --> 02:54:26,560
the dream you said all this [ __ ] all the

9823
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:29,200
things that you've said

9825
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:30,880
in the most non-politician way i've ever

9827
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:32,720
heard anybody describe these things

9829
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:34,000
i know you really mean these things this

9831
02:54:32,720 --> 02:54:36,000
is this is it's

9833
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:37,520
resonating with me that you're being a

9835
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:40,720
hundred percent honest

9837
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:44,000
and natural and that's that's

9839
02:54:40,720 --> 02:54:45,600
what we're missing in politics today i

9841
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:47,040
mean it's one of the things that made

9843
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:49,120
people excited about trump

9845
02:54:47,040 --> 02:54:50,399
as at least he was an alternative to the

9847
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:52,560
political talk

9849
02:54:50,399 --> 02:54:53,760
he was an alternative to politicians

9851
02:54:52,560 --> 02:54:55,359
speak where you know they're being

9853
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:57,200
dishonest and disingenuous

9855
02:54:55,359 --> 02:54:59,040
but you just accept it you know they're

9857
02:54:57,200 --> 02:55:01,120
reading things that have been written by

9859
02:54:59,040 --> 02:55:02,479
speech writers but you just accept it

9861
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:04,479
because it says

9863
02:55:02,479 --> 02:55:06,800
the things that you want to hear checks

9865
02:55:04,479 --> 02:55:07,760
the boxes that'll say okay you got my

9867
02:55:06,800 --> 02:55:09,120
vote

9869
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:10,720
what you're saying though is what you

9871
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:12,560
really feel and you really think and

9873
02:55:10,720 --> 02:55:13,760
you're not saying it like a politician

9875
02:55:12,560 --> 02:55:15,920
and that's what's going to resonate and

9877
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:17,520
people going to be mad at me if you get

9879
02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:20,640
pregnant you become president

9881
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:22,479
you made kanye west seem likeable

9883
02:55:20,640 --> 02:55:23,760
you turned him into the [ __ ]

9885
02:55:22,479 --> 02:55:25,600
president you

9887
02:55:23,760 --> 02:55:27,359
