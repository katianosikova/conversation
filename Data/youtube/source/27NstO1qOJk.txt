151
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,640
house that's how rich you are you don't

153
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,640
even have a house

155
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,959
how is that

157
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,200
yeah you know i'll restore houses i'm

159
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,400
very into architecture but i'm just

161
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,599
i'm not into the the class system where

163
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
it's like what that's one of the main

165
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,080
things they used to control us i think

167
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,000
my whole existence is about not being

169
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,159
out of control but being out of their

171
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,319
control being in control of yourself so

173
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,000
house is the first thing that they give

175
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,120
you that your entire existence when i

177
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,959
look out at

179
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,480
the skyscrapers in new york i'm like

181
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,760
everybody that's in all those buildings

183
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,680
spending that time away from their

185
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,680
family working

187
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,120
one of the main things the main thing is

189
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,280
the idea

191
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,640
of a house security yeah security

193
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,840
because i remember saying

195
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,519
uh

197
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,720
saying i was arguing with this one

199
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,959
publicist

201
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,120
and i told the person that i wasn't

203
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,360
going to have a house and they spazz on

205
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,680
me said you've done too much in your

207
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,400
life to not have a house you need a hat

209
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,639
like so try to

211
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,800
impose that idea

213
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,320
of but you know my home is just when

215
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,440
when my daughter facetimes me that's

217
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,440
where my that's where my home is

219
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,639
but you were staying in the

221
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,000
mercedes-benz arena

223
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,440

225
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,680
jail cell i'm going to throw it out

227
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,919
there yeah well except for i could come

229
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,880
and go so

231
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,880
right big difference

233
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,160
but yeah you know it's this idea this

235
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,759
monk lifestyle like this

237
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,880

239
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,880
that's kind of

241
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,560
on the same wave right now that they

243
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,160

377
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,360
and

379
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,800
you know it's a couple of times so i

381
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,440

383
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,440
you don't have no room

385
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,800
okay let me look for a room for you

387
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,960
that's a different kind of currency

389
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,039
yeah the the vision of life is not to

391
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,800
have money and possessions is to have

393
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,240
relationships and make it to the point

395
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,919
where i've done so much for so many

397
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,599
people that my money is can't spend

399
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,759
anywhere to go to a restaurant they'd be

401
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,120
like oh your money's no good here so

403
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,120
they said they charge me for the room

405
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,919
but they gave you a room

407
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,440

409
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,840

everybody plays games in different kind

799
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,600
of ways and you can't be mad for

801
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,480
somebody at the end of the day this man

803
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,000
has sold more records than anybody and

805
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,839
part of his

807
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,800
technique and basketball people got

809
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,639

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,160
to the gym with kobe

813
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,000
and we didn't even really get to play

815
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,440
ball all he did was show me videos of

817
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,440
scottie pippen

819
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
and you know scottie pippen's got a wide

821
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,800
wingspan but he didn't talk about that

823
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,600
he talked about

825
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,000
how fast he was moving his feet

827
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,959
and he was like oh this is inhuman

829
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,480
right it's inhumane this is like

831
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,800
and he was studying that he wanted to

833
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,279
learn how fast he moved his feet so

835
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,839

own factories we're going to be jumping

991
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,600
up and down for the idea like virgil

supremacist racist and homophobic that's

1001
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,520
the bottom that's the baseline that's

1003
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,200
another thing i don't even get the word

1005
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,559
for it but it's like a phobia of mental

1007
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,320
health that's the thing when people try

1009
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,520

1259
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,840
they they are leaders right you know so

1261
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,640

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,360
captured that's what i'm saying we got

1279
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,919
it and then it's like that hit you with

1281
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,440
like an accusation or somebody that you

1283
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,840
was with

1285
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,080
you know 10 years ago

1287
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,840
okay and then also it's like there's

1289
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,440
women who have been through

1291
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,600
really serious

1293
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,039
things pulled in alleys

1295
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,039
against they will

1297
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,640
that's different than a hug right but

1299
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,039
it's classified

1301
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,000
as the same thing it's classified as the

1303
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,200
same thing you know it's it's power and

1305
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,360

you know power hungry maniacs and just

1309
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,679

1311
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,919

um

1369
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,240
i actually wrote the day before kobe

passed the melody

1373
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,360
and we ended up and the funny thing we

1375
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,080
went back and forth on this song and

1377
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,000
when we did the listening event down in

1379
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,880

1381
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,240
the listening event in uh atlanta

1383
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,400
the first one

1385
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,000
for howard land we started with twitter

1387
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,159
for the donda outfit

1389
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,559

1391
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,440
out the trenches living up making all

1393
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,200
right

1395
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,600
and then the funny thing i had a clip of

1397
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,960
kobe and his daughter

1399
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,039
in the video

1401
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,640
and we called his wife everything and we

1403
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,679
couldn't get it cleared

1405
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,679
but one of the things when kobe pass

1407
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,559
there was somebody that i used to work

1409
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,279
with

1411
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:32,159
whose wife literally

1413
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,400
uh tweeted let's not forget

1415
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,400
that

1417
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,080
kobe

1419
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,200
was accused

1421
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,600
and that's what they said that's what

1423
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,120
reacted to that yeah because okay

1425
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,640
continuously so that's what they said

1427
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,039
because you talk about superheroes right

1449
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,400

to my children and everything but

1465
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,960
it's it's none of these things that can

1467
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,960
make me and that's the idea of being a

1469
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,000
nomad i like that term though because i

1471
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,039
was talking to the head of ikea about

1473
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,440
creating i'm sure he won't like that

1475
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,799
keep going

1477
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,159
i'm gonna do it

1479
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,640
this is the first person that went and

1481
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,640
meet himself

1483
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,039
so why you not you're not laughing you

1485
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,039
didn't like that

1487
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,840
i'm looking i'm reading the energy in

1489
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,840
the room

1491
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,000
here comes the backlash

1493
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,120
he gonna be like so i was just talking

1495
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,799
and said look

1497
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,840
we need to create

1499
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,240
um

1501
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,640
better situations for homeless people

1503
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,559
you know it's a really utopian

1505
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,760
dictator concept okay we're going to

1507
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,760
eradicate

1509
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,360
homelessness what about people who want

1511
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,399
to be homeless and there's a lot of them

1513
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,399
that want to be there's a lot of people

1515
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,159
so that would change you got to think we

1517
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,760
used to have water fountains now we got

1519
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,480
a plastic problem because of water

1521
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,399
bottles that's capitalism

1523
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,919
you know everyone only thinks about

1525
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,880
themselves especially our black leaders

1527
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,279
right

1529
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,399
when none of us run on stage what none

1531
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,360

1533
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,039

1535
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,640

idea of what it even means to be a

1769
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,240
billionaire but to not color

1771
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,120
inside the lines you know my mom was

1773
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,120
born

1775
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,440
into a drinking fountain

1777
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,799
they told her what fountain she could

1779
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,320
drink out of

1781
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,039
now we born into a vote they literally

1783
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,320
call it the black vote yeah and by the

1785
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,279
way

1787
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,120
we blood of christ we blood of moses

1789
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,360
we're not just a color in the crayon box

1791
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,200
and if we knew that who we really were

1793
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,120
we'd treat each other differently we'd

1795
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,919
treat ourselves differently so when you

1797
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,799
say i'm black and i'm proud

1799
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,360
like

1801
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,799
but of what what what concept are we are

1803
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,559
we understanding they say go see the

1805
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,480
african history museum

1807
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,159
why did they start when when the boats

1809
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,159
came why don't they start with the drums

1811
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,559
when we was kings and yeah oh they don't

1813
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,799
want it but we are kings but the 400

1815
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,559
years doesn't have to deal with slavery

1817
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,720
it has to deal with the bible it has to

1819
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,960
deal with us being disobedient to god

1821
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,600
right and that's why we

1823
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,039
farm land that is in our own record

1825
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,559

2063
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,320
we're talking about the mobile homes

2065
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,320
this is my home

2067
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,119
that's my house my home is when my

2069
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,880
daughter facetime but my house is that

2071
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,119
backpack nice okay so this is who i was

2073
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,040
gonna ask you one of the most

2075
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,760
controversial records or most dopest

2077
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,400
records i've ever heard you make was um

2079
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,280
biggs brother was biggs brother used to

2081
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,040
be

2083
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,240
and i

2085
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,359
thought that that was so honest

2087
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,680
because a lot of people

2089
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,680
um

2091
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,480
i i believe the word jealous is not a

2093
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,400
bad word but i'm sometimes you could be

2095
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,160
jealous and say i want what this person

2097
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,839
wants that doesn't mean you're a hater

2099
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,839
hate is something different

2101
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,800
hate is i despise you

2103
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,079
and

2105
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,880
i felt like

2107
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,480
that's

2109
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,800
not what it was saying

2111
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,079
with that record but it was like i want

2113
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,079
this slot

2115
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,640
and i'm gonna i'm gonna stop at no means

2117
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,599
of getting a slide am i

2119
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,400
yeah absolutely okay and i think about

2121
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,560
when i do things you know i go and be on

2123
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,160
my monk i'm just traveling the world i

2125
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,960
have a home stuff

2127
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,280
and but when we go in like we was doing

2129
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,359
the listening sessions we want to make

2131
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,240
it hurt that's what competition is we

2133
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,480
made

2135
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,240
we made everybody push this summer back

2137
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,040
you know drake pushed back those release

2139
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,920
dates that's for fact that that actually

2141
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,119
you know

2143
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,960
actually happened and then they had

2145
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,160
people coming out saying oh you know he

2147
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,599
um

2149
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,280
you know the other thing i saw this

2151
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,240
thing that style said

2153
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,720
about this going back and forth honestly

2155
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,839
it's interesting to people but man i i

2157
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,560

okay you know over the past decade

2173
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,240

2179
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,400

2181
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,760
um

2195
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,920
drives and the the way somebody is more

2197
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,320
technical

2199
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,480
yeah the microchips right the processors

2201
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,440
they're processors right

2203
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,560
we are god's ultimate iphone we are

2205
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,880
god's favorite creation so if steve jobs

2207
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,520
was god

2209
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,880
we would be his iphone

2211
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,760
and

2213
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,960
we

2215
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,319
are simply

2217
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,640
programmed

2219
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:09,119
and we go with the program

2221
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,520
and some are unprogrammed and some of

2223
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,599
the unprogrammed are people who they say

2225
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,839
are crazy or people who go off the rails

2227
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,400
people who end up homeless and the

2229
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,280
program are the people who go

2231
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,280
with the program and you have this thing

2233
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,839
like when i said when i hit you with a

2235
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,160
wyd you better not hit me with a hui you

2237
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,280
better be like hi with a bunch of eyes

2239
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,400
or hey what a bunch of what so

2241
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,319
it's

2243
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,000
you know people who heard that song

2245
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,160
would text me back

2247
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,640
with a bunch of eyes a bunch wise we

2249
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,079
just right there adjusted the

2251
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,400
programming

2253
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,440
that's simple that's what media that's

2255
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,599
the mind control is all about can you be

2257
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,400
a part of the programming what i say to

2259
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,560
drake is he added something to the

2261
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,560
algorithm

2263
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,720
as we become more

2265
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,520
civilized and more sophisticated the

2267
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,839
style of rap that he was doing was more

2269
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,280
sophisticated than the style of rap that

2271
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,160
i grew up on now i had notes from nas

2273
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,800
and

2275
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,520
rock kim and obviously from me but i

2277
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,040
also had notes from shade right had no

2279
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,960
some people want to make jokes about

2281
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,560
that but it made it

2283
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,560
massages the shade there you go

2285
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,000
so so that made it

2287
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,160
his music

2289
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,119
was more accessible this time when like

2291
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,119
rap wasn't as accessible and he created

2293
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,079
this thing that actually has

2295
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,960
good melodies in it you know good good

2297
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,079
music in it that became massively

2299
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,760
uh

2301
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,880
accessible so it's sort of like the

2303
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,880
iphone

2305
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,200
music is such an interesting thing to

2307
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,000
create a genre to create in because grab

2309
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,400
music right now grab it with your hands

2311
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,640
it's like uh it's in the air intangible

2313
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,040
right it's intangible it's intangible

2315
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,880
like the concept of a relationship

2317
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,359
you know saying you you you with

2319
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,040
somebody you might only see them twice

2321
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,560
out the week if y'all married you might

2323
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,040
only see them two hours a day three

2325
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,000
hours a day before y'all go to sleep but

2327
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,400
y'all together it's a concept that you

2329
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
you you live on an idea you know and

2331
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,400
it's in this gta we are an idea so for

2333
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,920
instance i got to say this to boo i kind

2335
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,960
of feel like

2337
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,359
he knew

2339
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,119
that i was working on cities

2341
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,560
he knew i wasn't working on cities but

2343
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,880
when you think about a city who you

2345
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,160
think about acon

2347
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,240
so i feel like

2349
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,359
who's like man you know

2351
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,880
i'm gonna let you know you're about to

2353
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,880
drop this city right now i get

2355
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,880
yeah which is period civilizations your

2357
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,480
man right here was like are you working

2359
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,079
on that epcot you know cities of the

2361
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,160
future i'm like man how you know he said

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,920
man no way but i know what wave you on

2365
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,680
so um

2367
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,520
because nobody never liked it to go to

2369
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,440
wyoming until you went there

2371
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,560
yeah or even afterwards apparently some

2373
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,920
of you afterwards

2375
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,839
they only came to wyoming for you i'm

2377
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,760
just telling you yeah it was a step you

2379
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,440
know the problem is they say you know i

2381
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,280
was talking to jay prince and talking to

2383
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,960
elon cause there's another we're going

2385
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,960
to do another driver elon musk

2387
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:24,880
[Laughter]

2389
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,560
so i was talking to jay prince and

2391
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,960
talking to elon which i that's an

2393
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,119
amazing combination

2395
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,520
it's an amazing spectrum it's actually

2397
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,319
closer yeah than we think

2399
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,000
why is it so far wow real talk you know

2401
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,000
i'm saying when i think about

2403
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,359
you know certain people's ability like

2405
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,839
business someone he know how to read a

2407
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,319
contract is it's that's how it's very

2409
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:48,000
few of us that's seven feet tall and

2411
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,400
very few of us is three feet tall we all

2413
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,680
play our position inside of this

2415
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,680
modern day

2417
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,160
wakanda that we actually in we're at the

2419
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,040
brink of it you know i'm saying

2421
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,800
after this interview i possibly could be

2423
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,319
taken out but no

2425
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,200
the interview has happened though

2427
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:09,040
because i've infected y'all yesterday to

2429
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,040
think in the yay way we

2431
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,319
it's like when they say this is the man

2433
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,800
on the moon this is the first black

2435
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,040
animal i i just telling people like

2437
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,640
investors people we haven't spat oh i

2439
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,359
was with the black

2441
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,359
a white person first of all we all

2443
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,960
beings alike we're not we're not even

2445
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,920
classified under race but if we're going

2447
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,920
to be

2449
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,200
inside of race conversation don't be

2451
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,839
telling me what you then did for the

2453
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,400
black people i started the black spack

2455
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:41,200
or this black or this black investments

2457
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,960
for hair hair clippers and would you

2459
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,520
think i you know i might be into i

2461
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,319
remember being out in san francisco

2463
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,240
bro

2465
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,359
it's like i ain't never made money with

2467
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,119
not one person from silicon valley

performance and one dude says hello uh

2535
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,359
get clear you were a little crazy on

00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,400
twitter at one point

2539
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,079

00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,720
it right for them to shadow man it's

2545
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,920
freedom of speech though too you're

2547
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,920
taking that away

2549
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,280
yeah and what was the craziest thing

2551
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,359
it's frozen

2553
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,960

crutches we could benefit each other but

2589
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,319
the system

2591
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,640
tears us apart left and right

2593
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:57,119

00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,000
i can't get through that i can't get

2605
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,400
through

2607
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,880

did you see me on the count i went on a

2615
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,440
campaign i was talking about we talked

2617
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,200
about it you're talking about it i was

2619
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,119
like i was like

2621
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,480
i was by myself like that's not the

2623
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,880
people who supported me but i promoted

2625
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,880
you yeah

2627
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,920
when it's time to get free the only way

2629
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,440
we're going to do it is by

2631
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,359
leveraging anchors like the jewish

2633
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,880
community is not the most people in

2635
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:39,359
america but they understand how to

2637
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,680
collectively use they leverage to have a

2639
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,280
position that serves them

2641
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,599
you understand now what i keep on saying

2643
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,319
is we are us we are collective humanity

2645
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,240
we are collective but we so easy to get

2647
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,400
into like an ego thing just like with

2649
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,160
the drake thing man i love

2651
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,079
drake i was just telling you things that

2653
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,960
he was doing in a professional game of

2655
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,200
rap

2657
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,400
that was throwing me off and then okay i

2659
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,680

2663
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,440
happened that was mike tyson hopefully

2665
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,000
that was professional sports we in

2667
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,760
professional rap meaning it's too many

2669
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,839
people that get paid off of either of us

2671
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,040
for something to happen to either of us

2673
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,470
you know what i'm saying so we'll be on

2675
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:21,230
the record i'm gonna do this no you not

2677
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:21,230
[Laughter]

2679
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,800

2681
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,000
and it's it's lit and we get to be

2683
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,079
professional

2685
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,400
you know rappers for a period of time

2687
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,160
out of our life and pull in this energy

2689
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,920
and have people talking about it but

2691
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,920
it's a certain responsibility i think

2693
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,359
that it's a it's a redemption a

2695
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,720
redeeming quality that's what i have

2697
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:48,160
i'll be wanting to sit down with drake

2699
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:50,240
to say this just as an og to him is the

2701
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,640
redemption like when i i asked him for

2703
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,599
the beat for tsu that's my favorite song

2705
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,920
on clb and say mama is not around daddy

2707
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,920

2709
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,359
yeah okay yeah so

2711
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,720
uh

2713
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,440
i'm not gonna do a joke like man you

2715
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,559

2717
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,720
listen man

2719
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,319
i live in my own world too man i'm not

2721
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,760
exactly you or him but i live in my

2723
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,920
whole world too and i'm kind of the man

2725
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,920
in my [ __ ] so you know i'm sorry

2727
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,920
yeah

2729
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:30,269
okay

2731
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:30,269
[Applause]

2733
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,520
oh [ __ ] this is great this is great

2735
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,839
but but the

2737
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:40,160
redemptive quality is like that third

2739
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:41,440
verse because if you just leave it as it

2741
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,240
is it's going to stay

2743
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,839
as is and for me in my opinion lucy and

2745
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,319
grayjake got no problem with his staying

2747
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,599
as is i got a problem with his staying

2749
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,440
as is

2751
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,440
i gotta you know

2753
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,640
it's funny i called

2755
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,640
uh damian hurst that did drake's cover

2757
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,079
because i felt like

2759
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,920
i didn't like the cover i felt like he

2761
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,359
was trying to troll him or something i

2763
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,440
love damian hurst i just bought a couple

2765
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:07,520
of his pieces right now

2767
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,599
one of my top five favorite artworks of

2769
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,760
all time is these animals he put in

2771
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,119
embalming fluid so you know when you do

2773
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,480
my interview which i should have is just

2775
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,480
things just pop up at the bottom

2777
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,319
don't worry so he did this shark it's

2779
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,280
kind of similar to this scene in the

2781
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:25,119
cell that had j lo by tar sam or a horse

2783
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,200
separated like this so he actually did

2785
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,119
this and i bought

2787
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,200
a dove

2789
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,359
for my family for my wife to put it

2791
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,559
there and i bought this black sheep

2793
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:37,680
because that's

2795
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,680
you know that's um that's me so i bought

2797
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,520
a black sheet it's an actual black sheep

2799
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,599
and embalming fluid and it's by damien

2801
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,599
hurst who did the drake album cover so i

2803
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,559
think you want a real feat but it's

2805
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:52,839
physically it is it okay

2807
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:55,040
okay it is uh no i actually bought um

2809
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,559
uh [ __ ] i actually bought 1200 living

2811
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,480
sheep

2813
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:02,240
okay but i bought one

2815
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,599
so you're excited officially yes so um

2817
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,160
the

2819
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,240
uh yeah that was the

2821
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,760
easiest of my life so so it's that third

2823
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,640
verse i used to rap like this i would

2825
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,880
say

2827
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,359
uh girl and gave me no ass she needed to

2829
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,359
go down and the next line would say

2831
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,880
the pastor said i need jesus so i went

2833
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:21,920
to the church and let the water wash

2835
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,760
over my season i always gave a

2837
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,000
redemption you know i'm saying like it's

2839
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,880
like what bone thugs told you about

2841
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,119
you know

2843
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,800
feds sitting with them saying make

2845
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,119
negative music that's going to put more

2847
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,280
of us in jail it's documented you can

2849
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,760
load it up so

2851
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,160
we do that and you get like of god

2853
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,280
people travis scott drake

2855
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,119
kanye west we we of god god's plan and

2857
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,319
then we make these songs

2859
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,920
that

2861
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,119
don't have

2863
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,880
uh

2865
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,200
a redemptive quality in what we're

2867
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,559
saying because maybe we trying to look

2869
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,680
harder or be cooler or this that younger

2871
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:01,839
whatever it is and act like we ready to

2873
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,319
die as much as

2875
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,760
people who really got you know 10 bodies

2877
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,040
and really

2879
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,760
i'm sorry because

2881
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,520
did it because the the rumor is that

2883
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,440
drake kind of took a shot at you on that

2885
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,640
song but travis scott was on that same

2887
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,240
song

2889
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,160
it was married

2891
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,400
did you put

2893
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,839
oh yeah i put everybody on a group text

2895
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,200
everybody gets a group and what i don't

2897
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,760
like is like

2899
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,079
you know when i'm talking about who's in

2901
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,520
this group of texts it was jay-z kim

2903
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,960
kardashian

2905
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,960
so you got nothing to do with this by

2907
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,520
see this i talked to jay at the wedding

2909
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,720
the other day he didn't know when he did

2911
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,119
the song

2913
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,720

keep going

2981
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,559
but what i'm saying is as a community

2983
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,960
we have to police a and police ourselves

2985
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,240
so if you know you got a person

2987
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,480
that's

2989
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,079
you know we in a league we're in a

2991
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,960
league of our own right it's like the

2993
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,240
nba life itself but then also this like

2995
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,119
celebrity

2997
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,960
influential place of like musicians and

2999
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,720
influencers and stuff like that

3001
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,160
and they have [ __ ] that's called like

3003
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,599
flagrant fouls inside of the league

3005
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,680
so in this group chat did you tell

3007
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,559
travis scott that was a flavor from

3009
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:38,240
exactly okay because no the thing is he

3011
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,720
could have put the line on without

3013
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,319
everybody knowing so that means i felt

3015
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,200
like everybody should go to drake and be

3017
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:46,240
like

3019
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,720
you ain't saying that to to north saint

3021
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,119
chicago and psalms dad

3023
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:53,040
because he could be saying [ __ ] that's

3025
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,400
poking at me

3027
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,960
and and

3029
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,680
and driving me crazy

3031
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,680
and then if i do something that seems

3033
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,760
crazy then they just blaming me it's

3035
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,520
like every [ __ ] that got locked up it's

3037
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,760
a reason they didn't do it just because

3039
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,599
their life was perfect and they had all

3041
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,960
the opportunities in the world and their

3043
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,720
dad brought him up there's very few

3045
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,079
people like that there's this born

3047
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,680
serial killer that's what they want to

3049
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:20,079

3051
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:22,400
and ain't nobody like i you know i have

3053
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,319

actual act of it you know the act the

3095
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,640
anticipation of something is the is what

3097
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:09,040
we live in now is the shortest moment of

3099
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,720
our life now the now that was just there

3101
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,000

3103
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,599

3105
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,359

3109
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:21,280
would rather you did and i just actually

3111
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,720
just need to deal with the finality

3113
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,079
because my mind i'm like a xerox printer

3115
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,240
i you know i'm christian but i'll tell

3117
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,680
you something i talked to a healer that

3119
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,720
said i'm dealing with resentment from

3121
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:36,079
multiple lives of disloyalty

3123
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,760
of the way i felt you know with

3125
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,520
virgil going to louie and just things

3127
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,119
that jealousy so it actually was a

3129
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,720
problem because that's what we've heard

3131
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,640
absolutely i was jealous what do you

3133
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,079
mean i'm a human being and people try to

3135
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,920
tell you what to say in press and what

3137
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:51,200
to feel like you don't feel that if you

3139
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,880
was in my situation and you ride no no

3141
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,680
this is the other thing sickle mode they

3143
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,839
would play it at the kid's party

3145
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,440
so i'd have to bring my kids to a party

3147
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:02,480

3149

song welcome to calabasas

3151
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,960
and then they wonder why you end up you

3153
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,680
know in the hospital there's it has to

3155
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,720
be some type of respect

3157
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,839
a male

3159
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,960
perspective a god perspective and some

3161
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:18,880
type of community leadership

3163
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,040

this man this man and that and that's

3191
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,400
pretty good for a black man since that

3193
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,760
was all the black first of all i said

3195
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,799
that before we got to take the black

3197
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,160
version

3199
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,760
off of it because i'm running i'm

3201
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,880

3213
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,119
make some noise for that

3215
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,400

3249
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,079
have virgil do a song for you but you

3251
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:41,920
wouldn't have drake pick out a purse for

3253
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,440
you you know what i'm saying but i i

3255
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,280
would compete with both of them at the

3257
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,440

3259
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,160

00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:55,920
this man been anointed with different

3267
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:57,359
skills so that's why i said i put them

3269
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,559
on a group text and it wasn't about the

3271
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:02,000
magic archeterics or kid cudi dress

3273
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,079
it's like you know how it is if you

3275
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,319
texting a girl or a girl text you back

3277
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:08,160
they might just a game some position

3279
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,599
text you back slow

3281
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,119
different things i don't let me tell you

3283
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,880
as the leader i don't operate like that

3285
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:16,240
don't be on my phone touch them chase me

3287
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,240

3291
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,799
that don't work with like i told you i'm

3293
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,799
a xerox printer

3295
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:31,040
meaning i could i could see a dinosaur

3297
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:33,119
bone and build a dinosaur out of it

3299
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,640

00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,480
build a dinosaur

3303
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,480
i'm gonna hear dinosaur born out of a

3305
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,079

00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,240
be like oh he never did this but that

3309
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,280
don't mean that line hasn't built an

3311
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,280
entire

3313
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,480
dinosaur bone and this is a perfect time

3315
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,760
for me to come back because you got to

3317
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,599

3319
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,359

3327
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,799

i literally had to go like thanos and i

3347
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,119
don't want to have to be the villain but

3349
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:27,280
when i went and did the donda thing

3351
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,440

3353
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,359
sit back and watch

3355
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,960
the real leader

3357
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,839
they could talk about goats and this and

3359
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,720
that it's like because i affect

01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,119
people 20 years younger than me

3365
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,960
and that's what it factually is and you

3367
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,520
got to know who you is and you got to

3369
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,960
tell people who you are man i got this

3371
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,240
money guy

3373
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,440
as i'm up here disappointed because

3375
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,559

3377
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,520
white people

3379
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,359
um

3381
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,359
but i got this money guy that said yo

3383
01:00:55,359 --> 01:01:00,160
you got 80 accounts open which is what i

3385
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:02,400
said it's the hit it's a way to kill me

3387
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,240
and he was just dismissive he was like

3389
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,040
man i just saw what trump did with this

3391
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,680
back

3393
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,839
and you can you can do this i said man

3395
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:13,280
when i do it we're going to get up to

3397
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:15,440
elon and bezos and arnold territory

3399
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,280
uh and he just says to me very

3401
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,559
nonchalantly

3403
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,760
well i'm not going to say it's going to

3405
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,440
be all that

3407
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,200
three minutes later a conversation he's

3409
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,200
talking to me about you got 80 accounts

3411
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,720
to open and this is ridiculous he said

3413
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,319
it at the beginning

3415
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,160
you know i said i already heard that i

3417
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:32,400
started raising my voice then he checked

3419
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:34,400
me like who you screaming at who you

3421
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,559
screaming at but it's like boy when you

3423
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,920
said when you dismiss me and when i try

3425
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,520
to stand up and you push my shoulder

3427
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,240
like that that's a part of the

3429
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:45,040
programming in schools today i see my

3431
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:47,200
son do his homework at sierra canyon

3433
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,040
that because i could

3435
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,160
because daddy got his own school you

3437
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,559
know

3439
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,799
called donda named after my mom

3441
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,799
the first black female english chair of

3443
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:58,799
chicago's uh english department chicago

3445
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:01,280
state so he's doing his homework and

3447
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:02,880
it's it's math and it's got three eggs

3449
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,280
and two eggs and says three plus two

3451
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,520
equals what and he says five and the

3453
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,920
next one has three eggs plus two eggs

3455
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,359
and it says two plus one equals what and

3457
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,000
he says five

3459
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:16,079
and see the the picture was wrong with

3461
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,640
the number he starts getting frustrated

3463
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,400
he starts crying he doesn't understand

3465
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,920
and i was there

3467
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,760
you know thinking he was too young for

3469
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,000
me to explain to you i was like no this

3471
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,000
is getting you prepped to be pulled over

3473
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,599
for no reason

3475
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,520
and think it's okay

3477
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,960
this is getting prepped for you to be

3479
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,400
the person that deserved a job and

3481
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,480
someone else get the job

3483
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,000
they hire virgil over you

3485
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,280
and you think it's okay you can't say

3487
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,520
nothing because you're a sellout to

3489
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,799
black people if you say you got to go

3491
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,400
get a hug

3493
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:46,400

3495
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,640
you prepped it's prep school right baby

3497
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,760
yeah it's preparation

3499
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,960
for your limitation

3501
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,000
that's deep

3503
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,760
that's deep

3505
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,119
we in these schools right now baby oh

3507
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,559
you thought i wasn't gonna get killed by

3509
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:01,119
the end of this interview i'm gonna try

3511
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,480
my best no

3513
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,960
though though you give it the shoulder

3515
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,520
gotten worse you're giving it to us

3517
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,359
you know what i'm saying but it's a part

3519
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:12,160
of the overall slave ship and the same

3521
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:13,760
mentality when i cut when i cut my hair

3523
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,359
like this did you cut it yourself while

3525
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,119
barbara did that let me tell you i

3527
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:18,559
should have cut my hair myself because i

3529
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,799
was in europe so you paid a [ __ ] to do

3531
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:21,920
that no no tell me

yeah

3537
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,240
it's funny that you say that because i

3539
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,839
asked he kept on like cutting it because

3541
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,000

01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,240
walked away like man i did this to kanye

3633
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,599
west it's something that you asked for

3635
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,760
too yeah

3637
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:16,000
yeah and then

3639
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,839
a few days later

3641
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,319
i cut my hair now mind you i thought it

3643
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:22,720

01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,880
it on the ground was that yeah

3649
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:29,920
but the fact that my hair cut and my

3651
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,319
name came at the same time

3653
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,160
yeah it had to be something because to

3655
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:36,480
do that this was harder than wearing a

3657
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,520
trump hat because every time

3659
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:41,680
is my my image you know i'm i'm i'm fly

3661
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,359

01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:55,440

so much

3675
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,240
so then i'm sitting in the mirror at the

3677
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:02,720
hotel and i grab and i remember oh snap

3679
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:04,880
i have a barbara skill set and an art

3681
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,240
skill set and i started cutting because

3683
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,400
one of my home girls like i think it

3685
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,559
need a lining because it just looks

3687
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,839
really good

3689
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:14,319
and i was like i ain't finna get no

3691
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:16,480
lining i got nine billion dollars

3693
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:17,599
i don't need no line

3695
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,000
so

3697
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:22,160
so then i um

3699
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,640
i cut it a different way and the name of

3701
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:27,440
our basketball team is the doves

3703
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,880
the donda duffs so i like

3705
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,799
um

3707
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,280
i started to cut it like a dove so this

3709
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:35,599
is actually three doves cutting my hair

3711
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,359
and what i like is one patch will grow

3713
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:39,599
back and it starts to make these layers

3715
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:41,440
and i said you know i'm an artist

3717
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,319
like a process

3719
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,000
artist

3721
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:45,359
and i'd like to let people in on a

3723
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,599
process like what we did with the

3725
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:49,280
rollout so when you see

3727
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:51,200
the hair it's like you see the process

3729
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,799
of the haircut you also see the process

3731
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:55,520
it's like a representation of my

3733
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:58,319
thoughts developing because of how close

3735
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:00,720
it is to my you know to my to my head

3737
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:01,839
and then the whole thing is it it gotta

3739
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,640
look

3741
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:05,039

3743
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,720

01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:30,880
this is about to be a thing yeah

3771
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,559

3779
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,960

[Applause]

3797
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,880
this is kind of a serious question right

3799
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,880
because um

3801
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:17,520
i remember when nas

3803
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:19,679
um named his company ill will right yeah

3805
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:22,560
and i believe that he had to change the

3807
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,560
name of his company because

3809
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,279
it's easy to say like [ __ ] it will but l

3811
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,319
will is an actual person elroy was his

3813
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,839
actual

3815
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:33,600
best friend yeah so did this was it ever

3817
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:35,120
a time where you said that about naming

3819
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,960
your album that because let's suppose

3821
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,560
somebody don't like this album and

3823
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,880
somebody could say [ __ ] donna they're

3825
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,359
not saying [ __ ] your mother but they're

3827
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,679
saying [ __ ] the actual material did you

3829
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:47,839
ever feel any concern about that name in

3831
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,759
it after after her

3833
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:51,359
not at all but i have seen them do these

3835
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:55,120
things when when everybody said they

3837
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:56,080
liked donda way better than uh clb they

3839
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,679
had this thing when they had these

3841
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:00,560
football players coming up saying what

3843
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,159
you like better clb or donda and then

3845
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,759
they was like clb and then one of them

3847
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:06,799
was like yeah [ __ ] donda i was like bro

3849
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:08,080

3851
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:10,410

no but um so so

3859
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:26,159
you did feel that a certain way like it

3861
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,920
was a football player saying [ __ ]

3863
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:30,239
yeah but he was saying [ __ ] the album

3865
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,440
okay so moving on

3867
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,960

but that's the thing that's the moment

3991
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:38,080
when

3993
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,560
uh obviously like nas made

3995
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:43,040

me the sample she gave me the sample for

4007
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,560
the truth and she gave me a sample for

4009
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,080
takeover

4011
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,760
she's like eyes is one that kind of

4013
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,760

4017
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,960
don't don't don't take it oh you know

4019
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,719
let's kanye yeah we have a game on our

4021
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,920
show yeah

4023
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:14,640
what'd you finish are you oh yeah i

4025
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:18,000
wanted to say about some about related

4027
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:20,400
to takeover oh okay the algorithm okay

4029
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,840
is that your [ __ ]

4031
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:26,239
that was the moment when jay-z

4033
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,080
went like this and nas was like this

4035
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:29,920
because nas couldn't we go in chicago we

4037
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,719
call it sniping

4039
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:34,320
nasa is my favorite rapper

4041
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:35,840
i said that man

4043
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,320
yeah many times i said this is my

4045
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:39,600
favorite rapper but the moment when it

4047
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,040
shifted

4049
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,130
was

4051
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,280
the um

4053
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:44,159
[Music]

4055
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,440
when

4057
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:49,920
nas couldn't wrap that style and jay-z

4059
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:52,000
could and i think the moment i need you

4061
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,360
to clarify what you mean i'm sorry then

4063
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,960
is that your [ __ ] and y'all on this

4065
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,199
ride when you're holding this

4067
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:00,000
like how we got from chicago okay okay

4069
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:01,840
okay how we call the sniper how how bone

4071
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,719
thugs like double dragon would you say

4073
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:07,600
double time twist and yeah we call it

4075
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,480
sniping right so but nas he could he on

4077
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,760
snipe

4079
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,920
you know something like that and then

4081
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,719
the thing that i feel

4083
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,400
uh affected jay was actually deaf of

4085
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:19,040
auto tune

4087
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,239
because auto-tune didn't die

4089
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,320
right

4091
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:24,640
actually it's like the most i think the

4093
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,840
most influential artist actually of the

4095
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,760
past

4097
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,480
10 years is future

4099
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,640
oh most important most influential to

4101
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,920
our sound today and then you you throw

4103
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,000
in

4105
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,440
you know chief keef you ever took you

4107
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,040

4109
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,440
uh no no

4111
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:43,120
and then also one thing is like with

4113
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:45,760
soulja boy

4115
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:47,120
is top five most influential and i'm not

4117
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,679
going to argue with you [ __ ] about

4119
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,679
this at all

4121
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,159
as far as to what we are today yeah you

4123
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:57,280

black mother that the baby's not gonna

4251
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:32,480
come out today because we are inside us

4253
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:33,440
as 12 tribes of judah as a member of the

4255
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,400
hebrew

4257
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:38,640
people

4259
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:42,400
we are still inside of our genocide 50

4261
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:44,560
of all black deaths a year is abortion

4263
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,719
and

4265
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,480
black deaths a year is abortion

4267
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,520
and plan b

4269
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:55,520
was created by margaret sanger with the

4271
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:58,320
kkk for black population control

4273
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,560
uh you're getting deep right now yeah

4275
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:03,679
this is what i cried about

4277
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,280
during the election that those tears is

4279
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,679
gonna be gospel

4281
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:10,000
someday and what am i doing i know the

4283
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:12,480
guy from texas got a lot of backlash for

4285
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,080
changing the laws i'm not in a position

4287
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,480
that's not what i'm doing what i'm doing

4289
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:19,120
is providing a plan a

4291
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:21,199
opportunity where you can bring

4293
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:23,440
your children

4295
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:25,360
if you feel like you can't take care of

4297
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:27,520
them you ain't got a place to take them

4299
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,760
you don't have a support system we got a

4301
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,199
place that's gonna have i'm like you

4303
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,480
thought i wasn't gonna try to get killed

4305
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:36,719
in this interview dr sebby's diet right

4307
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,920
based off dr sebby's diet

4309
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,640
saving

4311
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:43,360
not only black children but all god's

4313
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,640
children given the opportunity of a

4315
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,159
utopia

4317
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,159
because the reason why we ain't get our

4319
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:50,560
40 acres in a mule is we have 40 acres

4321
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:52,239
we have more people we have more people

4323
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:54,880
and we have leadership

4325
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:56,880
with the leaders not strategically taken

4327
01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:00,320
out of the community in the 80s and the

4329
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:03,520
drugs and guns put into it and then the

4331
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:07,199
algorithm you know i'm saying the 808

4333
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:09,440
the 808 exists in the lowest chakra

4335
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:12,800
of your body the majority of content

4337
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:15,920
that's related to the 808 is killer or

4339
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:18,400
sexual content the original 808 was even

4341
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,239
off pitch so that meant it's an actual

4343
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,840
sound in the track that you don't

4345
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:25,360
realize is there

4347
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:27,600
that is [ __ ] up your entire frequency

understand shakespeare created 30 of our

4653
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:44,800
language we speaking the language it's

4655
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:47,520
not our own we speak the drums that's

4657
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,199
why it's so hard that's why it's so hard

4659
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,440
for it to be a black billionaire and

4661
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:53,040
it's so hard to get a post malone you

4663
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,400
know what i mean like a white black dude

4665
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,239
or something you know you get it's so

4667
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,600
it's very

4669
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,600
few and far between that somebody can

4671
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,280
figure out because the game and society

4673
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,360
america has been made for us to not

4675
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:05,679
figure it out so all these books when we

4677
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,520
go to college and we discriminate again

4679
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:09,199
against each other we got this degree

4681
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,280
that ain't gonna add up to [ __ ] to us

4683
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:12,960
getting a job for another white person

4685
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:15,120
and i gotta say that you know why

4687
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,199
because

4689
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:20,159
my i was separated from my dad and i

4691
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:23,199
just now understand what happened my mom

4693
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:25,440
was an actress but she also had a b plan

4695
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:28,159
of being an english professor

4697
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:30,080
um and she went for a gig and she didn't

4699
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:34,080
get it and she went to be a professor

4701
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:35,280
now her and my dad is separated but

4703
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,440

4721
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,080
opportunity since i was 14 because i was

4723
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,000

4741
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:13,840
me

4743
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:16,239
for the opportunity of more money

4745
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,639
society is set set up to have people go

4747
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:20,480

01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:24,320
or in between your hometown and where

4753
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,480
you got to go to school it's going to be

4755
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:28,320
a bunch of liquor stores it's going to

4757
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:30,560
be a bunch of strip clubs there's going

4759
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:33,120
to be a bunch of malls it's going to be

4761
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:35,440
a bunch of things that people we do

4763
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:38,400
that when we don't have that love like a

4765
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:42,000
kibbutz we need christian kibbutz we can

4767
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:43,199
have communities be as close but kibbutz

4769
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,120
like

4771
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:46,800
jewish people have

4773
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:49,360
this type of circular community like a

4775
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,800
community center no it's like where they

4777
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,960
live and where we need to live where the

4779
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,560
grandparents can take care of the kids

4781
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,480
it's better to have a grandparent taking

4783
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,800
care of kids than a nanny

4785
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:59,840

5811
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:43,199

fear and reading every single comment

5815
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:46,880
and be in her ear all the time giving

5817
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,239
these mid-level suggestions not one

5819
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:50,159
suggestion i would ever take from this

5821
01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:52,080

our press or what the kids names is she

5833
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,560

for this

5913
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:30,560
yeah outcast for me okay okay that was

5915
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:32,719
pretty cool scarface uh ice cube

5917
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:35,520
that's another one i just talked to

5919
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:37,679
scarface yesterday

5921
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:40,560
it's so crazy and then

5923
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:42,480
you know i i'll be hanging with cube oh

5925
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:44,960
[ __ ] for me

5927
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:48,000
it's a shot

5929
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:50,159
i'm trying to see who influenced me more

5931
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,119
i i i

5933
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:53,360
like

5935
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:55,199
cube better personally for like if i

5937
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:57,679
play his listener

5939
01:48:55,199 --> 01:49:00,000
but scarface is more influential to me

5941
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:02,000
as a rapper and to everyone as a rapper

5943
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,760
he's another important part because when

5945
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,840
scarface switched his style when he

5947
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:08,400
started turning his words like around

5949
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:10,480
like mary mary every man i got this love

5951
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:11,600
for him in my life and indeed another

5953
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:14,320
form of life

5955
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:16,000
jay will add that scarf flow to this

5957
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:18,719
flow i'm talking about people who added

5959
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,520
to the flow um you can't say it's not a

5961
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:23,599
specific thing where people could even

5963
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:25,760
wrap like ice cube because rap ice cube

5965
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:28,159
until he like really did the yeah and

5967
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:30,159
like added a style to it his style was

5969
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:32,400
kind of similar to mine where it's like

5971
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:34,320
it was sort of you couldn't pinpoint it

5973
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,320
you couldn't imitate it you couldn't it

5975
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,840
was just like cube me and cube is both

5977
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:43,320
gemini's you're both saying the same

5979
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:43,320
thing from virginia uh gemini yeah

5981
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:51,920
yeah gemini's got the most uh goats and

5983
01:49:50,159 --> 01:49:53,360
rap though okay so basically you're

5985
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:55,760
saying biggies are just saying no you're

5987
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:57,679
saying are you saying

5989
01:49:55,760 --> 01:50:01,040
i'm saying

5991
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:02,400
tastes uh like my you know music is i

5993
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:04,800
love both of them but i'm gonna say cube

5995
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:07,199
but i'm saying scarface was more

5997
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,800
influential as a rap because he added

5999
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:10,719
like you gotta look at rap like it's the

6001
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:14,239
nba and there's certain people remember

6003
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:16,560
kobe's shoot up like this or like ai or

6005
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:18,960
you know people have added things to the

6007
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:21,679
overall game you know the half of the

6009
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:22,639
nba is like number 23 it's you know

6011
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:24,800
people

6013
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:26,159
and scarface added

6015
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:28,159
something to it that people don't

6017
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:29,760
pinpoint enough and that's specifically

6019
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:31,360
when he did that i would like to get

6021
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:33,679
into the science of rapping and science

6023
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,679
and music

6025
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:39,040
um

6027
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:40,239
travis scott or kid cudi

6029
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:41,360
kid cudi

6031
01:50:40,239 --> 01:50:44,639
because

6033
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:46,800
travis is a mix of me cuddy and rocky

6035
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:50,400
jesus okay

6037
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:50,400
little baby or the baby

6039
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:55,199
man what i was saying is like hmm

6041
01:50:55,840 --> 01:51:01,360
no because they they both are equally

6043
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:04,960
adding something new

6045
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:06,880
to rap itself like it's mad people

6047
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:08,719
that rap like people just rap like

6049
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,840
little babies like listen

6051
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:11,679
so many people just rap like little

6053
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:14,400
[ __ ] you could pick pick wolf won't

6055
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:16,000
pick one okay you can pick one and take

6057
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:18,560
a shot if you big both you sound like

6059
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,560
you said both

6061
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:23,280
i'm gonna go with little baby okay

6063
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:24,880
opportunity because i did say little

6065
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,920
baby is my favorite right because the

6067
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:28,000
thing is

6069
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:30,719
and i just hear his raps

6071
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,880
you know he was on it was a concert plan

6073
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:35,119
and it just it just put me into a mode

6075
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:36,560
it's like he hit something

6077
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:38,719
and you know that's what like rap it

6079
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:40,400
gotta and that's the thing if [ __ ] is

6081
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:42,159
that's what like rappers i feel like

6083
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:43,679
lose that ability

6085
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:45,280
to really put people in that mode where

6087
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:47,679
they want to like

6089
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:49,760
do better business work out create

6091
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:51,760
whatever they want to do it's like

6093
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:54,159
if you lose jokes because it ain't

6095
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:54,159
nothing

6097
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:57,679
it's it's nothing i said in this

6099
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:58,960
interview that's not what i would say

6101
01:51:57,679 --> 01:51:59,679
and it's interesting

6103
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:01,760
yeah

6105
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:03,599
yeah not that i wouldn't feel and i

6107
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:05,360
think it's interesting that it comes off

6109
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:07,280
as shocking in any way

6111
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:09,280
because i'm not really saying nothing

6113
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:11,040
shocking it's like you know

6115
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:12,560

6151
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:03,840
tendency to have been emotional in the

6153
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:05,920
past and to do things in an emotional

6155
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,599

6261
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:10,080
was going to be my album follow-up to

6263
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:11,440
dark fantasy that i heard when we all

6289
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:38,480
gonna i took a new day off on my next

6291
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:40,800
album i took otis on my next album and

6293
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:42,960
we got into this big argument because he

6295
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:44,800
had this song called holy grail that he

6297
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:46,080
had justin timberlake

6299
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:48,639
and i was like we need to put this on

6301
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:50,159
this album and then he's like nah and

6303
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:52,639
that's why everybody knows jay is very

6305
01:55:50,159 --> 01:55:54,159
selfish and we had a very like damn i

6307
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:56,800
didn't know this go ahead

6309
01:55:54,159 --> 01:55:58,800
come on it's jay-z man

6311
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:59,840
i love him

6313
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:01,199
we

6315
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:03,360
we all love him but you know he's very

6317
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:06,320
selfish and that was a he'll say he's

6319
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:08,000
like man i'm selfish i'm selfish

6321
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:09,840
okay so um

6323
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,599
he wouldn't give that song i'm like man

6325
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:13,280
how i'm giving off what you're saying is

6327
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:15,040
holy grail was originally supposed to be

6329
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:17,440
on watch the no it was supposed to be on

6331
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:19,440
his album okay but he and i said we need

6333
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:21,119
this because we don't need to be losing

6335
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:22,960
like hal lebron and him and just lost in

6337
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:24,400
this championship he wanted to make that

6339
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:25,840
even better i wanted to make the i'm

6341
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:28,239
better he wanted to say to him it's

6343
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:30,000
something that i heard that that's when

6345
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:33,280
y'all fell out because like no we fell

6347
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,280
out many times as my brother okay

6349
01:56:35,679 --> 01:56:40,130
so whenever you do some j [ __ ] and i do

6351
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:46,480
some yay [ __ ] we don't say [ __ ]

6353
01:56:40,130 --> 01:56:47,760
[Laughter]

6355
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:48,880
that's some real [ __ ]

6357
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:51,280
so um

6359
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:53,520
when i um

6361
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:56,840
get lifted i don't know why john legend

6363
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:56,840
voice just came

6365
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:04,650
[Laughter]

6367
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:11,840
all right so um

6369
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:19,199
so anyway um what we talked about

6371
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:20,880
holy grail no no holy grail

6373
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:23,199
we got mad about that i was like i'm

6375
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:25,920
giving all this and you ain't giving the

6377
01:57:23,199 --> 01:57:27,040
equal amount and i find that in life

6379
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:31,040
period

6381
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:32,320
i i i i find that you know i love jay so

6383
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:35,040
much it's like i love the city of

6385
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:37,280
chicago so much and it was always like

6387
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:39,040
the same thing with jay or chicago they

6389
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:41,360
always wanted to be somebody more

6391
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:43,360
gangster

6393
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:45,280
they didn't want it to be yay

6395
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:47,280
that was if it would kim maybe she

6397
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:49,840
wanted to be a ball player or something

6399
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:52,880
you know it was like nobody wanted to be

6401
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:54,480
yay or you know uh with the lvmh group

6403
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:56,639
but differently they wanted to be

6405
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:59,040
somebody who's more controllable they

6407
01:57:56,639 --> 01:58:02,159
didn't want it to be you know

6409
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:05,599
uh they didn't want it to be yay and

6411
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:07,760
it's always like this uphill

6413
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:09,679
battle i still i you know so far i just

6415
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:11,679
could never erase

6417
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:14,639
the way tata would look at me sometimes

6419
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:16,480
when i go to the to the studio and i

6421
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:18,719
always felt like it was an error that

6423
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:20,800
like no matter how big you get [ __ ]

6425
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:21,760
[ __ ] you you know me like that kind of

6427
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:23,760
thing

6429
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:26,000
and that's how i always that's how he

6431
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:27,920
always makes me feel so whenever i like

6433
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,000
get mad at jay i get mad at tata at the

6435
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:33,119
same time always like

6437
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,119

the same thing

6441
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:37,599
because you know you'll never forget

6443
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:39,520

watch was when i was taping i was at a

6753
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:04,719
church

out of japan this is where i went boom

6761
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:13,040
so that [ __ ] at the bottom of the screen

6763
02:04:10,079 --> 02:04:15,199
boom boom boom so the pastor

6765
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:16,880
was talking to me

6767
02:04:15,199 --> 02:04:18,480
he said something he's like man

6769
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:19,760
you know why racism because he's a white

6771
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:22,000
pastor so he wouldn't just instantly

6773
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:23,840
talk to me at racism he said ray simpson

6775
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,119
isn't wrong it's because you know god

6777
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:27,040
don't make junk and i'm thinking like

6779
02:04:25,119 --> 02:04:28,880
don't say it like that man

6781
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:31,280
don't worry it's like no

6783
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:33,440
that's not your explanation for racism

6785
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:35,040
but this man i'm talking to him about

6787
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:36,639
man i i want to

6789
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:38,560
uh i want to pull my family back

6791
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:41,360

02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:42,480
not that helpful to that but the it is i

6795
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:44,079
don't think it is

6797
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:45,440
good yeah i think so because i got to

6799
02:04:44,079 --> 02:04:47,040
get the people about the life that

6801
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:48,880
shouldn't be in the life that's my wife

6803
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:50,639
at the end of the day so it's like i'm

6805
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:53,360
using it because by the way i can't do

really care about the product and

6925
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:02,960
usually that's how these numbers guys

6927
02:07:01,119 --> 02:07:04,239
are and then they start seeing people

6929
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:06,480
love the product they always say we care

6931
02:07:04,239 --> 02:07:08,880

02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:27,199
demna the head of balenciaga that's what

6949
02:07:24,079 --> 02:07:29,440
i'm saying i'm a community builder i'mma

6951
02:07:27,199 --> 02:07:32,159
put together the right people at all

6953
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:34,320
times but the people that have in the

6955
02:07:32,159 --> 02:07:36,239
past been in a position of power gonna

6957
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:39,520
try to separate

6959
02:07:36,239 --> 02:07:40,400
jay and dame separate my mom and my dad

6961
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:42,960
separate

6963
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:44,960
me and virgil you see the pattern that

6965
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:47,760
makes it impossible for black wall

6967
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:49,199
street but wall street you know forever

6969
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:51,440
begins simply because i thought about it

6971
02:07:49,199 --> 02:07:53,599
the way comments said i thought of our

6973
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:55,840
community growing but we don't when we

6975
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:57,920
not force to make the ch the choice of

6977
02:07:55,840 --> 02:08:00,079
whether or not we can afford to have a

6979
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:02,639
child we're not forced to say i'm gonna

6981
02:08:00,079 --> 02:08:04,639
have to you know i'm gonna have to

6983
02:08:02,639 --> 02:08:06,480
kill this [ __ ] because he said this and

6985
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:08,639
this that you know you never hear about

6987
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:10,000
jewish on jewish crime you know they

6989
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:12,000
kill each other in business in a

6991
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:14,639
different kind of way but

6993
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:17,280
not actually physically taking a life so

6995
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:20,000
when me and q went into business on a

6997
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:22,480

7227
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:35,360
dollars in like an hour when you put my

7229
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:37,040
name uh next to it

7231
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:38,079
and

7233
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:39,440
um

7235
02:12:38,079 --> 02:12:42,960
so

7237
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:44,079
i'm gonna go i'm gonna take myself

7239
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:45,199
public

7241
02:12:44,079 --> 02:12:49,119
and create

7243
02:12:45,199 --> 02:12:51,599
a universal basic income

7245
02:12:49,119 --> 02:12:53,920
and go public for

7247
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:56,880
a tea

7249
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:58,880
publicly do we all know what a t is no

7251
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:01,760
a trillion yeah but publicly traded

7253
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:03,760
public yes right and make

7255
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:06,000
a universal

7257
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:08,400
not even universal basic income but

7259
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:10,719
universal wealth because if everybody

7261
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:12,079
has a hundred thousand a year some

7263
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:15,040
people can spend it wrong right right

7265
02:13:12,079 --> 02:13:17,760
but it changes what we value right now

7267
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:20,560
they pump in so many logos and so many

7269
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:23,280
you know all the the wrong kind of

7271
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:25,679
concepts but it's inside of us we

7273
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:27,840
collectively are god

7275
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:30,560
we as a collection god is in us so

7277
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:32,159
collectively we are god as we move like

7279
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:34,560
when they move around mecca when you see

7281
02:13:32,159 --> 02:13:36,800
that you see god

7283
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:39,520
inside of that the way those people are

7285
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:42,000
moving once we move and we realize that

7287
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:44,239
we just all have to be on one accord

7289
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:46,880
like to do what quincy jones did in the

7291
02:13:44,239 --> 02:13:49,520

7411
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:03,760
to even be taken as

7413
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:05,119

7415
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:06,639

7417
02:16:05,119 --> 02:16:07,920

7419
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:09,840

7421
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:11,679
he showed us as kings you know what man

7423
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:13,360
it's like you know we do these cameras

7425
02:16:11,679 --> 02:16:14,560
if you take the camera we can some of

7427
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:16,840
the things i would do is like put a

7429
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:20,000
camera this way that goes this direction

7431
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:21,520
because you're gonna look like a god he

7433
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:23,679
you took that camera a little bit lower

7435
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:25,360
and when you sit it my dad was a

7437
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:28,079
photographer also so he explained that

7439
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:29,360
to me and you look a certain kind of way

7441
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:31,440
the press

7443
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:34,000
the way they paint us

7445
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:36,479
you know will make us feel like that's

7447
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:38,479
all we could be and that

7449
02:16:36,479 --> 02:16:40,080
it makes our ceiling like that but hype

7451
02:16:38,479 --> 02:16:42,479
went in and painted us a certain kind of

7453
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:44,000
way and when you saw belly

7455
02:16:42,479 --> 02:16:46,399

7457
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,319

02:23:59,439 --> 02:24:02,319
going to be clapping for just getting a

7843
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:04,640
job

7845
02:24:02,319 --> 02:24:06,640
for arnold until we get to the level you

7847
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:08,720
know i'm saying when lebron wins the

7849
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:09,840
championship he looks at this white lady

7851
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:11,359
that owns

7853
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:13,520
the team and says i told you i was going

7855
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:16,479
to win for you

7857
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:18,720
that's the part i don't like

7859
02:24:16,479 --> 02:24:21,280
that's the part because if you king then

7861
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:24,080

7867
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:30,240
freedom to be able to build our

7869
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:32,640
communities and not be in a position

7871
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:35,040
where we have to kill half of ourselves

7873
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:37,040
every year okay now they hit a third

7875
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:38,319

7877
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:42,200

7879
02:24:38,319 --> 02:24:42,200
