1
00:00:00,569 --> 00:00:02,707
(pop music)

2
00:00:02,707 --> 00:00:05,290
(crowd cheers)

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,783
- Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,080
Thanks for coming out.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,080
I think everyone knows who my guest is (giggling)

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,460
and we also have Steven Smith, lead designer

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,100
of Yeezy who, unless you're a sneaker head,

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,990
you might not know that well.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,140
So, we should probably all realize now, Yeezy is

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,500
a multibillion dollar brand.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,240
It did something like, 1.5 billion dollars

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,770
in sales last year.

13
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,640
It's wholly owned by Kanye West,

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,220
and the two of them, Kanye

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,580
and Steven, came together a few years ago.

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,800
Met up and sort of lead Yeezy Design now,

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,610
and what I wanna do today is have a conversation about that.

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,140
No one's really dug into the nuts and bolts

19
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,690
of Yeezy Design, yet,

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,723
and so, let's start with, how did you find each other?

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,500
- Oh, you know, I had...

22
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,170
I was working for another company

23
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,210
and I was head of innovation, and it wasn't innovative

24
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,140
and I walked away one day.

25
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,556
Which people are like,

26
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:17,730
(Kanye laughs)

27
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,950
you just left your job?

28
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,420
I'm like, yeah, it just wasn't it, and,

29
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,830
So for two weeks my wife's like, "What are you gonna do?"

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,840
I'm like, "I don't know."

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,930
But I wasn't doing that, anymore.

32
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,723
And then one night, the phone rang, and it was Ye,

33
00:01:35,468 --> 00:01:36,440
and it started from there.

34
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,170
I looked at it as a blessing.

35
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,090
You know, I was in a kind of a dark place,

36
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,460
and this hand reached out and pulled me to the light,

37
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,520
and pulled me from the depths to the top,

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,630
and it's been an amazing experience ever since.

39
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,100
I was just saying to Ye this morning.

40
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,290
It's like, the last time I was

41
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,550
in New York was the time you flew me out to meet you

42
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,770
in person the first time.

43
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,130
So, it's just been amazing.

44
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,590
- If I had known that you had just left your job,

45
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,750
I wouldn't have spent two hours tryin'

46
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,228
to talk you into coming to Yeezy.

47
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,910
(laughter)

48
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,330
- I mean it's funny.

49
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,670
Steven, if you look through his portfolio, it's just,

50
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,240
it's staggering.

51
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,260
New Balance created some of what you might consider

52
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,350
the quintessential New Balance shoes.

53
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,850
The dad shoe.

54
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,440
At Reebok, they created this--

55
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,072
- They call him the dad of the dad shoes.

56
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:31,910
(laughter)

57
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,930
- At Reebok, created something totally just different,

58
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,160
and that looks like the anime-inspired film

59
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,260
that you actually inflate with an external inflator.

60
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,250
Still sold today as many designs are,

61
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,083
and now, and now Yeezy.

62
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:54,090
Talk to me about the first design you did together

63
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,490
or how that process started.

64
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,190
- You started going through all

65
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,370
of your archives and sketches and pullin' out...

66
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,420
I remember these pictures of, it's like the Tupperware.

67
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,770
- The bins of all my stuff.

68
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,040
- The bins of all those ideas,

69
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,360
and it was a sketch with a sole with those circles on it.

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,263
Now signature to the 700,

71
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,300
and you know it was...

72
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,910
- I remember you said

73
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,450
to me, like, "Did they ever make this?"

74
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,350
I'm like, "No."

75
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,557
He goes, "What the hell is wrong with them?

76
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:32,587
"All this stuff is amazing.

77
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,190
"Let's make all the things you've always wanted

78
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,170
to make that they were too stupid to make."

79
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,510
I'm like, "Let's go!"

80
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,241
(laughter)

81
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:44,300
And, the final design, it was Ye, myself,

82
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,360
and a young Chinese kid, Ding,

83
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,860
and for 48 hours straight, I'll never forget it.

84
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,455
We passed sketches and tests--

85
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:54,730
- And people are now saying Ding's name

86
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,733
to the entire shoe industry.

87
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:57,610
(laughter)

88
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,443
- It's a--

89
00:03:58,443 --> 00:03:59,343
He can get all the calls.

90
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,430
- And so, 48 hours straight, he

91
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,910
and I texted, emailed, whatever, sketches back and forth,

92
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,100
and they were photoshopped and I would redraw it

93
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,660
and send it back to him.

94
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,620
We'd take this part and put that part out and mix it up,

95
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,430
and it was like nothing I had ever done before,

96
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,603
and it was just mind-blowing and exhausting.

97
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:24,387
And finally I told Ye, "Dude, it's two o'clock

98
00:04:24,387 --> 00:04:25,257
"in the morning, and I'm old.

99
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:26,650
"I gotta go to bed."

100
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,010
(laughter)

101
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,020
And out of it came that last one to me

102
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:34,860
and after 48 hours, boom, this thing came out, and it was

103
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,490
an amazing experience, like nothing I had ever done before,

104
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,747
and I'm like, "Yeah, this is cool."

105
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:43,650
- And that's that shoe you're wearing right now.

106
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,483
- Yeah.

107
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,120
And when it dropped, I mean the thing sold out

108
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,970
in six and a half minutes, which was incredible.

109
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,483
I mean, who wouldn't wanna be part of that magic, you know?

110
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:59,332
And it's continued ever since.

111
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,230
- And we were, before the movement, the resurgence

112
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,430
of the dad craze,

113
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,430
and we, there was a photograph of me wearing the shoe.

114
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,490
Really big version of the shoe that we showed

115
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,250
in the season five fashion show,

116
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,130
and this paparazzi is great sometimes,

117
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,080
'cause they caught me wearing the shoe a week

118
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,330
before the Balenciaga show

119
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,820
that had the Triple S's in it,

120
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,240
and it's often like, me and Demna, the head designer

121
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,960
of Balenciaga, have a similar spirit,

122
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,270
and it's who's gonna get to the idea

123
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,270
and bring it to the world, beforehand?

124
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,420
If you remember, there was a paparazzi campaign

125
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,420
that I dress every girl up to look like my wife

126
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,520
in the campaign and then Balenciaga was working

127
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,070
on it at the same time,

128
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,140
and their campaign came out like two weeks later,

129
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,429
and it was just, the worst shame to the company

130
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:55,604
that they had.

131
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:56,830
(laughter)

132
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,980
That they had got get there afterwards,

133
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,450
and then there's stuff one to one,

134
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,190
at the last Balenciaga show

135
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,740
where I can show you one to one stuff in our office.

136
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,567
I'm like, "Who's got cameras in our office?

137
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,750
"Who's seeing what we're doin?"

138
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,978
So--

139
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:10,322
- Not me, no.

140
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:15,322
- Yeah, so, that process, it's a balance between

141
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,750
really being diligent about making the best product

142
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,890
because we don't put a timeline on things,

143
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,870
but the idea of competition

144
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,530
that's out there helps present a timeline for people,

145
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,750
and it makes things be better

146
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,750
and forces us to as creatives to bring things

147
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,770
to market because Yeezy is the Apple of apparel.

148
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,020
There hasn't been an Apple of apparel.

149
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,885
There hasn't been that thing.

150
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:54,200
It's like you want, you wanna think.

151
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,460
You see like a friend come in

152
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,007
with a cool UNIQLO jacket and you all be like,

153
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:00,717
"Wow, this is like the Apple of apparel.

154
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:02,210
"You got an UNIQLO."

155
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,700
And it's like these weird dresses all over the place

156
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,270
and it's just like, this is not the way I picture it,

157
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,050
or you know, I grew up, I worked at the Gap.

158
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,780
When I was 16 I got fired for shoplifting

159
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,780
and the, I couldn't afford a Abercrombie.

160
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,520
I could afford Polo because it was at Marshalls

161
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,438
and TJ Maxx 'cause (Steven laughs)

162
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:22,271
it was cheaper.

163
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:25,130
But that way that Mickley Drexler made the Gap feel

164
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,200
and I'm still, and I'm really happy about

165
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,730
this founder Alberdie said about retail and the experience.

166
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,080
You know, me and wife, we went

167
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,930
to Dover Street last time we were in New York,

168
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,505
and we went to Jacob the Jeweler,

169
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:39,850
and it was just such a beautiful experience

170
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,260
to be able to go back into these physical spaces

171
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,410
in this world, it's so like D-to-C and online

172
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,900
and it's just therapeutic just

173
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,250
to see the way someone else layin' out the clothes

174
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,600
and it's just like, all these members

175
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,330
of the industry are so important.

176
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,530
The buyers, and the shoppers, and the sales clerk.

177
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,410
I was a sales clerk.

178
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,890
I was folding t-shirts at the Gap.

179
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,990
At one point, it's the entire experience

180
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,990
from the Steven Smith sketch to someone linin' up

181
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,360
for the Yeezy.

182
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,193
- It's a, he's a...

183
00:08:11,193 --> 00:08:12,124
- Yeah.

184
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,480
You know, I mean, and you think about what we do,

185
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,300
and you think about you did with Gap.

186
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,430
It's like we create objects of desire.

187
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,030
I mean, if we don't love it, how could we expect--

188
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,245
- No, I folded objects of desire.

189
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:26,030
(laughter)

190
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,550
- You are prolific designers together, though.

191
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,160
You go through so much and how does working at Yeezy

192
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,160
compare to Reebok, or the time you spent at New Balance.

193
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,740
- You know what?

194
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,333
The thing I love about Kanye is the rules are gone.

195
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,650
We just, everything you've ever done, it's just been

196
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,440
smashed to pieces,

197
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,930
and we think about it completely different,

198
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,930
and it's just, it's liberating creativity

199
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,160
like I've never experienced before.

200
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,200
When I worked at Nike

201
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,680
or any other big corporations, you're a cog

202
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,060
behind a desk and it's preprogrammed

203
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,250
with, oh, we're gonna have a focus group.

204
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,140
Well get a brief.

205
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,850
We'll pitch it to management.

206
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,280
10 people will decided what we're gonna do from there

207
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,657
and then you'll do four more sketches

208
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:21,600
and then 10 other people will decide on that,

209
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,550
And then we'll show it around

210
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,690
and get people's feel for it, and it just takes forever.

211
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,220
And with Ye it's just like, go!

212
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,720
And we create, and it's like nothing else.

213
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
you can't describe it till you're in it.

214
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,470
It's, magic--

215
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,780
- [Interviewer] What I hear a lot talking to designers is,

216
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,900
design's about constraints, and so I hear sort

217
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,880
of the opposite end of it,

218
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,010
or am I misinterpreting how you work in terms

219
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,030
of removing rules?

220
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,863
- My favorite-- - He'll,

221
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:52,010
He'll put some constraints on us.

222
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,970
- What's some of those constraints?

223
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,380
- No laces.

224
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,528
- That's our new constraint.

225
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:58,361
I don't need - No stitching.

226
00:09:58,361 --> 00:10:00,300
Sunday service, having to tie my shoes seven times

227
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,631
in the middle of service.

228
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:03,160
(Steven giggles)

229
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,690
- But you know, it's relatable problems, we're solving.

230
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,850
- It's Yeezy, make life easy.

231
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,477
We gotta put all the,

232
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,893
(laughter)

233
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:15,010
all the work in, so you guys don't have to put the work in.

234
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,060
Even as we think about the way colors work together.

235
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,060
The way, I was sittin', my wife this morning takin' a bath

236
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,950
and I'm literally reading to her the psychology of colors.

237
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,840
This is true, right?

238
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,510
She's trying to just take a bath.

239
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,430
I'll read you something.

240
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,940
This is what she has to hear

241
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,290
(laughter)

242
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,436
in the morning.

243
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,360
It kind of reminds me of, what did that Wes Anderson,

244
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,490
the Grand Budapest Hotel?

245
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,167
The way the guy would just read poetry to people

246
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,700
and they were like, people were fallin' asleep

247
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,533
while he's talkin'.

248
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,960
- It's just not you, Kim, it's all of us.

249
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,187
- So it says, "Blue, safety.

250
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:53,887
"Symbolism, no immediate hazard psychological effects.

251
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,450
"Blue is considered beneficial

252
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,640
to the mind and body, slows humans' metabolism,

253
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,440
releases calming hormones.

254
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,455
I'm just, this is my wife, "I just wanna take a bath."

255
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,303
(laughter)

256
00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:07,717
- He said, "No, you need blue."

257
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,240
A lot of, my take on fashion design has always been

258
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,630
that it leans more toward art,

259
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,320
that it's art you wear,

260
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,000
that sometimes it looks radical, it looks uncomfortable,

261
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,200
and then later it feels different, accepted and great.

262
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,350
And then I feel like the design with a capital D tends

263
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,390
to be about solving problems, right?

264
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,320
Recognizing that something has a better user interface.

265
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,450
We've eaten with forks for thousands of years

266
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,800
because it's a good design.

267
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,960
Where do you see your work on the spectrum of that,

268
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,130
and do you see yourself going more into

269
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,440
that design with a capital D with these?

270
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,727
- Absolutely, all finger foods.

271
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:50,130
(laughter)

272
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,020
No more forks, forks are dangerous.

273
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,040
- [Interviewer] Toothpicks.

274
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,950
- I don't know anything about toothpicks,

275
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,227
but yeah, it's you know, da Vinci, a lot of people,

276
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:02,360
I'm 42 years old, a lot of other greatest artists

277
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,630
of all time, at age 40, say, "I'm tired of doing

278
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,760
what everybody wants me to do."

279
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,187
And da Vinci's like, "I'm tired of painting these portraits

280
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:16,143
"for the rich elite women and I wanna go and do bridges."

281
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,530
We have to add science behind it now.

282
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,100
I think Yeezy...

283
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,050
I definitely think there was a breakthrough

284
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,015
in what we did in the 350s

285
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:29,510
and the 700s and, but still there's things.

286
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,238
We weren't lookin' at color palettes.

287
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:34,290
It's kind of been more of an opinion

288
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,770
on something than it was a complete innovation.

289
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,010
So now, today, that's what me and Steven are here

290
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,843
to talk about.

291
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,150
It's how Yeezy is goin' into innovation

292
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,850
and we moved the headquarters to Cody, Wyoming.

293
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,010
We have a four thousand-acre ranch,

294
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,620
and a couple other properties out there.

295
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,020
We're gonna be farming and going seed to sow,

296
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,930
and have our own cotton hydroponic farm,

297
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,090
and our own hemp farm, and our own weed farm

298
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,580
so we could see every element and getting into

299
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,830
how we could have less impact with the dyes

300
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,830
because our color is a big signature of the brand,

301
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,900
but also dyeing, is one of the main things

302
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,460
that's impacting the planet in the fashion industry.

303
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,980
So, just being responsible from A to Z

304
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,580
and what happens, even

305
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,490
as we're bringing, within the next two years, we are,

306
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,070
our goal is to bring the manufacturing back

307
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,720
to America, South America, North America.

308
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,050
Bring it back to State side, and also

309
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:41,050
to prevent, present jobs for people back here.

310
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,390
- And people thought Ye was blowing smoke two weeks ago

311
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,267
when he said that, "We're gonna manufacture Yeezy

312
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:51,369
"in the U.S."

313
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,170
And people are like, "Come on."

314
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,230
So, I got off the plane last night

315
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,690
and these are the future of Yeezy.

316
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,690
These we're just made in Atlanta yesterday

317
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,540
in the U.S. at pre-production

318
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,210
and we're gonna start manufacturing in the U.S.

319
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,080
We're gonna bring jobs back here

320
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,030
and we're gonna make Yeezy's an America,

321
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,330
and so this is revolution.

322
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,289
This is--

323
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:21,130
- [Interviewer] This is a hundred percent made here?

324
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,530
- Yes.

325
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,460
- [Interviewer] What's it made of?

326
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,260
- This particular one is a hybrid of EVA

327
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,840
but it also has another foam

328
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,950
that's blended into it that's from algae.

329
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,860
It's harvested from ponds,

330
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,860
so its eco concerns are intersecting with what we do.

331
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:43,210
I mean, this is just the beginning

332
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,790
of the future that Kanye envisioned for us

333
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,200
to start working on in creating and challenged us to

334
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,410
'cause it's always a challenge.

335
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,030
All right, let's do this, now.

336
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,000
All right, hold my beer.

337
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,133
Game on, let's go.

338
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,910
He's been saying he wants to make things in the U.S.

339
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,010
I'm like, "All right, let's go.

340
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,637
"Let's figure it out, we'll do it."

341
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:05,400
- We took the word try and we want out of it,

342
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,573
and we just do, like Yoda says,

343
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,850
and we were always, it was always this thing

344
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,340
where me and Virgil, we're just trying to get a opportunity

345
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,723
to be able to have an opinion on clothes.

346
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,710
You know, as black designers out of America, you can't have

347
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,720
an opinion, you can only be the consumer.

348
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,010
You can only be a demographic.

349
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,737
And that a boardroom says,

350
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:34,910
"Okay, this is the black demographic, this is..."

351
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:39,910
You're not gonna go a whole interview with me,

352
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,030
without me sayin' it.

353
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,173
This is who you supposed to vote on.

354
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,670
This is what you're supposed to buy.

355
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,970
This is your Popeyes' chicken sandwich you're supposed

356
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,973
to eat on.

357
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,990
But it'd be exactly that.

358
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,470
I have seen the boardroom and back,

359
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,040
and it's completely a concept of a demographic.

360
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,130
So, for me and Virgil,

361
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,030
where, yeah, me, where he's African.

362
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,110
Africans have a different mentality.

363
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,620
They don't see racism, so they don't allow it

364
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,630
to affect their moves.

365
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,400
So, Virgil has never been in a position

366
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,400
where his color affected his decision to proceed

367
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,480
in the way he interacted with people.

368
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,484
Now me, a little bit, but it's,

369
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:31,570
(laughter)

370
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,010
But more of, it's a fire.

371
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,540
Okay, it's on me, but my mom got arrested

372
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,850
at the sit-ins at age six.

373
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,593
My dad was a Black Panther.

374
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,690
We were brought up in the church,

375
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,913
so we'd see it,

376
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,850
and see past it.

377
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,490
See past this theater that we live in,

378
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,163
that social media greatly controls.

379
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:58,036
And it's so funny to me.

380
00:16:58,036 --> 00:16:59,860
Oh it's so obvious.

381
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,930
Why wouldn't it be there?

382
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,500
When I was first doing my first fashion show in Paris.

383
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,917
Everyone said, "Well the Olsens started with a t-shirt.

384
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,940
"You should start with a t-shirt."

385
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,837
I don't want to do a t-shirt.

386
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:11,130
I want to do a fashion show in Paris.

387
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,680
As a matter of fact, I don't want to,

388
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,963
I'm gonna do it, and it's done, and it's so.

389
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,840
The life is, I don't know if you saw

390
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,297
that Venus Williams interview where this guy was asking,

391
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:24,850
"How do you feel about this match?"

392
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,490
Does anybody know the interview that I'm talkin' about?

393
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,593
This YouTube clip.

394
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,110
And she says, "Oh, I'm gonna win."

395
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,797
And they say, the guy says,

396
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:35,320
"Well, what makes you so confident?"

397
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,797
And then the father, her father came in

398
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:38,007
and said, "She's gonna win

399
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:40,160
"cuz she said she was gonna win."

400
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,487
Martin Luther King didn't get killed because of

401
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:43,360
"I have a dream."

402
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,340
He had something else he was gonna talk about.

403
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,000
Black empowerment.

404
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,770
Economic empowerment.

405
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,300
So, you know, when I did the Forbes

406
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,860
and I showed him an 890 million-dollar receipt,

407
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,230
and they still didn't say billionaire.

408
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,630
They don't want us to know

409
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,473
that we can buy land.

410
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,420
They don't want us to have the 100% ownership

411
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,750
that I have 100% ownership at Yeezy.

412
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,290
And the reason I say these things out loud

413
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,315
in this way, is so I won't be killed.

414
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,573
I said it out loud already.

415
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,670
Last year, I was killed by the press

416
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,770
for having a difference...

417
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,300
No, not having a difference in opinion,

418
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,503
for having an opinion.

419
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,100
I had a offer.

420
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,150
Yeezy season one was the most viewed fashion show

421
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,983
of all time.

422
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:45,640
Four times the Channel show.

423
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,747
So Bernard Arnault sat with me and said,

424
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:52,262
"We're gonna back your line, Kanye West."

425
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:53,900
Anybody's who ever been to Paris, have you been

426
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,800
to this restaurant called Ferdi?

427
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,650
It's like hamburgers, but you gotta go there when you go.

428
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,490
So, I got this deal with Louis Vuitton,

429
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,220
and I'm in the back of Ferdi about

430
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,930
to do the Kanye West line, and my designers were gonna be,

431
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,010
and they're sitting next to me.

432
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,880
Stefano Pilati and Haider Ackermann.

433
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,160
They were gonna be the head designers.

434
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,770
You might know Stefano from YSL.

435
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,240
Think about that, it's me, Stefano, and Haider.

436
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,950
That's gonna be chic, on chic, on chic, on chic, on chic.

437
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,580
It's gonna be the highest level taste, sensibility.

438
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,430
Stitch and double stitch, top stitch,

439
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:31,103
and three months later, so I had to go to Adidas and say,

440
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:34,127
"Hey, we gotta indemnify the apparel

441
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:36,840
"because all the A majors gonna pick it up."

442
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,901
So three months later, Alexander calls me.

443
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:41,900
I'm still friends with in our SSENSES.

444
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,750
At the board they pulled on the deal.

445
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,420
And this is like, I'm already thinking no way

446
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,630
Nicolas Ghesquière is gonna take a picture with me.

447
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,990
There's no way, 'cause you know it's like, the leech-ism

448
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,610
in fashion, and that would've...

449
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,747
Before Tim Bloom represented the famous sculpture,

450
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:01,080
before I had a PhD at the Art Institute of Chicago,

451
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,470
it's like Elvin Maich represented art

452
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,360
and fashion at the same time, so for a guy...

453
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,280
Straight, black, rapper, entertainer, American.

454
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,250
All these things are, you can't tell me

455
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,490
what t-shirt to wear, five years ago.

456
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,560
So for that to have happened,

457
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,590
that would have just broken, even the world wasn't ready

458
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,423
for that.

459
00:20:20,423 --> 00:20:21,340
I'm just sittin' there like, "There's no way."

460
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,640
And of course there was no way.

461
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,340
The first Adidas collection came out

462
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,340
and there were line ups around the store.

463
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,880
Then the second collection that we did, no line ups.

464
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,660
No store, no backer.

465
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,017
I told Adidas that Elvin Maich, I said,

466
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,697
"Hey, Adidas, I'm gonna marry Gisele.

467
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:39,790
"I know we just went on prom."

468
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,700
I came back, "Hey Gisele dumped me."

469
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,033
Uh, would you, you still wanna, you still wanna, so,

470
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,393
So, the second collection, there's no Yeezy.

471
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,310
The third collection, now, I'm investing.

472
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,660
I can't put an atelier together.

473
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,770
You can't imagine how hard it is

474
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,420
to get four amazing pattern cutters in the same room.

475
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,630
All right, so, I'm trying to put this atelier together,

476
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,907
and I'm Tweeting, and Mark Zuckerberg,

477
00:21:11,907 --> 00:21:14,837
"Hey, I'm in debt. I've just triple titled.

478
00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:16,757
"Adidas is up, we're doing this,

479
00:21:16,757 --> 00:21:18,417
"Mark, I heard you're looking for aliens.

480
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,997
"It's an alien, right here, come on me."

481
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,280
Season four, we start 45 minutes late.

482
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,740
Now season three, killed 'em.

483
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,330
MSG, a thousand people. We dropped out

484
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,180
with young thugs on the stage.

485
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,110
Travis Scott is jumping, Virgil's standing right there.

486
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:38,880
Everybody, 50 Cent, and Jay-Z, everybody's in the audience.

487
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,630
Season four, we start 45 minutes late.

488
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,300
Oh, it got to be Lebron James territory right there.

489
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,090
Like when Lebron said, "I'm goin' to the Heat."

490
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,717
They were like, "Boy, you was late."

491
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,323
Man, a week later, my wife got robbed.

492
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,760
Then a week later, I was tired

493
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,433
and ended up in the hospital.

494
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,620
Then a year after that Bernard Arnault could've picked

495
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,393
anybody he wanted to be the head of Louis Vuitton.

496
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,740
And who was it?

497
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,060
And as I got on that flight, I knew I had to go,

498
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,700
because if I didn't go

499
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,950
and give Virgil that hug, who was I, then?

500
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,240
No one knew that the deal had been pulled,

501
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,290
three, four years later, no one knew that

502
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,550
that was the beginning of me going to the hospital.

503
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,120
No one knew how this game is.

504
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,440
So now that I'd made it

505
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,920
to Vietnam, I'm gonna tell you exactly,

506
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,030
when the Forbes wants to call me a centimillionaire,

507
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,820
if people say it's crass to call yourself a billionaire,

508
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,280
I might legally change my name to Christian Genius

509
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,093
Billionaire Kanye West for a year,

510
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:52,570
until y'all understand exactly what it is.

511
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,328
- That's gonna be so hard to type, like in an article.

512
00:22:55,328 --> 00:22:57,210
The headlines are gonna get insane.

513
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,682
It's gonna break Twitter.

514
00:22:58,682 --> 00:23:00,043
Please don't.

515
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,220
- It'll be on the license plate.

516
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
(laughter)

517
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,823
There's one in three African Americans in prison, now.

518
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,810
There's a gentleman in jail in Houston, Rodney Reed,

519
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,670
that all the evidence says that this guy didn't do it

520
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,520
and he's supposed to be executed in 30 days.

521
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,440
And all the celebrity black will tweet about it,

522
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,880
but the question is, will they stop playing basketball

523
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,880
for a week, to make sure that this innocent man gets out?

524
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,293
For black people, I just say don't just be a demographic.

525
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,640
Own you power.

526
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,050
Your power is not just to vote Democrat for the rest

527
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,883
of our lives.

528
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,150
That's not the power, just voting

529
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,461
on who they told us to vote on.

530
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:49,900
That's not where the power is.

531
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,640
The power is, when I talked to my lawyer,

532
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,370
and Adidas was treating me mean,

533
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:58,190
and I had seven points of termination,

534
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,020
I put on my trench coat and said, "We movin' these factories

535
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,887
to America."

536
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,440
And that's how it's gonna be, and it's lovely.

537
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,730
Our relationship is beautiful now.

538
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,170
- Yeezy made it at the 350, for instance.

539
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,170
Is that something you're gonna be able to bring here?

540
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,020
Is it, because it's designed probably

541
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,720
with different tooling and things like that, an issue?

542
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,600
- Or we'll change the design.

543
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,050
We'll change it to something that has to be here.

544
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,120
When I run for president in 2024, we gonna definitely...

545
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,953
(laughter)

546
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:38,026
Now what you all laughin' at?

547
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:40,276
(laughter)

548
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,730
When I run for president in 2024, we would've created

549
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,330
so many jobs, that I'm not gonna run I'm gonna walk.

550
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,890
What I'm saying is, when you all read the headlines,

551
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,130
Kanye's crazy, this and that, this that.

552
00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:00,010
It's like, one in three African Americans are in jail,

553
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,450
and all the celebrities are in jail also

554
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,192
'cause they can't say nothin'.

555
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:05,253
They got no opinion.

556
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,970
They're so scared.

557
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,540
Even after this I'm gonna get in the car

558
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,213
and be like (panting), feeling like how I felt in telling

559
00:25:11,213 --> 00:25:12,735
that after I said you were a person

560
00:25:12,735 --> 00:25:14,410
who cared about black, you know what I'm sayin'?

561
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,660
I'm definitely gonna be ridin'.

562
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,327
My wife sits there and playin' like,

563
00:25:17,327 --> 00:25:19,303
"You know, K, maybe you shouldn't a (laughing).

564
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,120
- Let me pause you, because I do wanna finish the discussion

565
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,134
on design.

566
00:25:25,134 --> 00:25:25,967
- Okay.

567
00:25:27,265 --> 00:25:28,690
- And, you know, one project

568
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,890
that's gotten a lot of media coverage,

569
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,070
but I haven't really heard talked about much is building

570
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,500
the housing that was torn down, those, what's been called

571
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,590
Star Wars housing, Star Wars-inspired housing,

572
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,070
I assume, is not actually inspired by George Lucas,

573
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,903
but maybe.

574
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,550
Tell me where that was born from.

575
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,030
Tell me what you wanna do with it.

576
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,510
Is that going to Cody?

577
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,920
Is that part of Yeezy?

578
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,470
How do we think about Yeezy and where it's going?

579
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,980
because I hear things of sustainability.

580
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,453
I've heard you say you wanna hire a workforce out of prison.

581
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,240
Obviously, you have a strong direction for it.

582
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,773
- The building restrictions are way lax, in Cody.

583
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,430
That's one of the reasons we got the land, there,

584
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,220
so we can think.

585
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,870
You know, Dayton, Ohio, the Wright Brothers,

586
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,390
they needed a chance to think

587
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,940
or we wouldn't have flight today.

588
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:23,320
It's like, if the world only knew the capabilities

589
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,980
of what we have, the press would get out of the way

590
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,550
and stop downing.

591
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,030
I know it happens throughout history, but it's not...

592
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,160
'Cause you thought you were gonna go to design,

593
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,290
but the domes relate to this too, so,

594
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,270
- [Interviewer] The domes are obviously

595
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,060
about more than just design.

596
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,280
- So I have 300 acres in Callabas.

597
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,600
312 acres 'cause we got our little golden

598
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,080
situation inside hidden hills,

599
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,840
and we have 300 acres,

600
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,010
and of the domes, so we're testing the sides of the domes,

601
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:01,290
and it's, we do 50 feet, 35 feet high, or something.

602
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,440
And one of the domes were 10 feet too high,

603
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,060
and it was fine, we were just testing it.

604
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,490
We were gonna take it down anyway.

605
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,490
They came and said, "You gotta take it down."

606
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,300
Okay, that's fine,

607
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,650
but then they went to the media to tell them

608
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,683
that they told me to take it down.

609
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,313
Your dome is 10 feet too high, boy.

610
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,853
Your dome is 10 feet too high.

611
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,873
10 feet, on my own 300 acre property?

612
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,333
And we could've handled it like this,

613
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,330
but you wanted to go to the press before

614
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,020
to let everyone know

615
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,593
that you were tearin' down Kayne's domes.

616
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,730
- [Interviewer] They were worried the planes were gonna hit

617
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,390
at that height, I think, 10 feet.

618
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,223
- Yeah.

619
00:27:51,117 --> 00:27:52,500
- [Interviewer] But, is the idea of those domes.

620
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,460
What is the larger idea there?

621
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,110
What do you hope to iterate those into,

622
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,800
because I know iteration is a big part of what you do?

623
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,663
- We have absolutely no hopes.

624
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,563
- I only do.

625
00:28:05,496 --> 00:28:08,200
- [Interviewer] What are you going to do, then?

626
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,240
- Create the t-shirt, the t-shirt of homes.

627
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,370
Homes are a big, big representation of classism

628
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,883
and separation and protectionism.

629
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,080
The idea that somehow, this one little fence

630
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,510
can make the difference.

631
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,220
This gated fence can make the difference and say

632
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,050
this person hasn't made it in life.

633
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,050
I made it in life, so I need

634
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,330
to be behind this gate, right here.

635
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,890
So, to create something where, the actual information,

636
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:43,720
people used to get killed for proportions.

637
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,550
You know, proportions were sacred.

638
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,150
Now they're Gucci logo,

639
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,150
because the proportions give us the space

640
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,200
to maximize who we are.

641
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,030
We are God's iPhone.

642
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,420
We are God's machines.

643
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:00,420
He created us, so if the iPhone had it's choice,

644
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,270
It'd probably say I only wanna just lay

645
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,760
on my back, charge up all day long.

646
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,650
I don't want any of this extra...

647
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,210
I'm not gonna name any other brands that are

648
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,580
in iPhones, the Apple Store.

649
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,820
I'm not making this drop.

650
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,430
So, hey, that's the same thing for our spaces.

651
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,000
Dining rooms were created in the 1800s.

652
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,833
They're not needed.

653
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:21,720
What is a dining room?

654
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,730
Why you gotta have a dining room in your house?

655
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,600
So I'm very primitive in the way I think,

656
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,430
very singular idea.

657
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:31,610
3000 years ago, Rome was our original Silicone Valley.

658
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,150
A lot of the information is just,

659
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,110
even electricity, you know, Commonwealth Edison.

660
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,400
They did, it's the same thing you guys see happening

661
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,410
to me was happening to Tesla.

662
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,720
They were electrocuting elephants in the streets

663
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,920
with Tesla cords,

664
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,490
so that Tesla would have a bad reputation.

665
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,210
Anybody in this room every heard someone talkin' bad

666
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,890
about Kanye before?

667
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,830
Now, when you sit here, it's like, man, you know, maybe

668
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,470
this man should keep going.

669
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,420
Maybe we don't understand everything he's doing,

670
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,608
everything he's saying.

671
00:29:58,608 --> 00:30:00,140
Maybe we should just stop giving him a hard time

672
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,690
and give him a opportunity to change something.

673
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:09,690
Electricity is a very trendy form of power.

674
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,540
The real power is simply the elements.

675
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:16,330
Earth, wind, fire, water,

676
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,400
and through civil engineering,

677
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,520
we can engineer a maximum existence for ourselves

678
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,350
as human beings, as God's machines.

679
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,820
But we're so in the box of this,

680
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,740
do you realize, this right here, is like playing with dirt.

681
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,350
This is the real thing, right here.

682
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,800
We have telepathic abilities.

683
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,200
That's a headline they could use to try

684
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,800
to down this whole thing, right?

685
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,984
But we--

686
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:41,184
(interviewer laughs)

687
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:42,730
But, don't we feel each other?

688
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,350
That is a telepathic ability

689
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,950
that the green and black matrix numbers cannot control.

690
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,790
Do not be afraid of numbers.

691
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,640
How many people are afraid of what their,

692
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,060
how much you're gonna get paid this week,

693
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,070
and can you cover Christmas?

694
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,930
Can you cover rent?

695
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,300
Do not let the numbers control you.

696
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,863
That is 50 people trying to control the billion.

697
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,320
Do not let media and numbers control you.

698
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,480
Jesus Christ has already won the victory.

699
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,840
I'm gonna implement my opinion in that,

700
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,640
and do not, that is all control.

701
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,040
Media control, propaganda, setting us up

702
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,680
to be controlled by the roadie, radio.

703
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,280
I mean, these people study.

704
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,430
I'm studying the colors in this.

705
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,600
People are studying Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

706
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,760
The human needs, what we're needing,

707
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,420
and feeding it, especially to women on Instagram.

708
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,580
I'm not saying social media is all bad.

709
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:46,460
Angry Birds was a very popular game amongst women.

710
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,810
It had an action like this.

711
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,990
Scientists understood

712
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,290
that it released a dopamine, specifically in females.

713
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,330
What else does this?

714
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,020
And what does this?

715
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,960
And there's no amount of flowers that

716
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,230
that husband that loves you so much,

717
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,160
that can match up to the amount of flowers

718
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,110
that are delivered all like that.

719
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,943
I like that.

720
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:12,110
You got this many likes.

721
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,680
You got this many likes.

722
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,600
And also another thing we said, having

723
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,160
to show your amount of followers.

724
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,680
You could choose.

725
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,670
I choose to tell you I am a billionaire.

726
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,170
There's some billionaires that don't wanna do that,

727
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,670
so you can have, you should be, you have

728
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,880
to be able to choose it.

729
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,510
They have to put--

730
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,343
- [Interviewer] It's changing.

731
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:34,350
Instagram's testing it.

732
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,553
You see other platforms are testing it.

733
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,710
I think it's great you've been outspoken about it,

734
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,990
because it is ridiculous that a teenager has

735
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,360
to worry about how many people follow them

736
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,510
on Twitter, especially.

737
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,460
I guess, just to bring this back to Yeezy

738
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,610
for probably a closing thought, is--

739
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,050
- This is what Yeezy is.

740
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:51,883
You're talking.

741
00:32:51,883 --> 00:32:52,716
- [Interviewer] I love it.

742
00:32:52,716 --> 00:32:54,250
- You're talking to a founder.

743
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,487
This is a founder conversation.

744
00:32:56,487 --> 00:32:59,320
(audience applauds)

745
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,350
- [Interviewer] What Yeezy is in product design,

746
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:05,090
in urban planning, in whatever else you wanna tackle?

747
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,180
- We don't want to.

748
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,010
We will, and we are,

749
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,193
but that is the thought that goes into this.

750
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:13,920
It's not, oh, should we do, should we,

751
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,010
it's like, picture these domes that I'm talking about.

752
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,950
Picture these homes, picture this world

753
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,660
that we're talking about with the four elements

754
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:25,170
and understanding that the most healing medication possible

755
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,643
is love.

756
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,800
The greatest things that humans have is each other.

757
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,750
We need to be close to each other,

758
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,550
but industry has designed cities

759
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,900
where the house has to be a certain amount

760
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,870
of distance from the school, and a certain amount

761
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,150
of distance from your job,

762
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,930
so that you have to get in the car

763
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,690
and take public transportation,

764
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:47,700
and the world is set up

765
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,330
to make us feel like we want to have less children,

766
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,930
when children is the greatest thing and the closest thing

767
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:58,930
to God that we have, so we have to reengineer the cities.

768
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,560
When I see New York,

769
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,980
there's things that I definitely like about it.

770
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,870
I love New York.

771
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,100
But then I also picture, "I am Legend."

772
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,910
Once people understand the value of fresh air.

773
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,430
Look at this, we have real light out there,

774
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:13,440
and real air, but we're using air conditioning

775
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,930
and artificial light.

776
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,370
It's just retarded, and I'm sorry.

777
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,243
I can't say that word, anymore, so it's like,

778
00:34:18,243 --> 00:34:22,850
but, you know, and then we'll go into, oh,

779
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,930
this thing happened in politics and this thing.

780
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,570
The media will shift you in every way you can.

781
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,710
I tell, I say, MIT, wake up, the kids at MIT.

782
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,050
You can do it, but you're focusing on things

783
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:33,883
that are too small.

784
00:34:33,883 --> 00:34:35,560
I just gave you the blueprints.

785
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,980
This is why the guy

786
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,920
who made, M. Night Shyamalan, made "Glass."

787
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,720
To let everyone know that they're superheros.

788
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,580
And that was the whole thing at the end of the movie.

789
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,310
He had to show all the superheros climbing up the side

790
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,143
of the wall.

791
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:56,700
So today, you just saw someone climb up the side

792
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,533
of the wall.

793
00:34:57,533 --> 00:35:00,570
I went from 53 million dollars in debt, considered

794
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,330
to be crazy, discriminated against,

795
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:08,330
and music and fashion in business in apparel,

796
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,890
and I'm coming to you today, saying, we have our own farms.

797
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,620
Cody's a great place to stay if you're into working

798
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,830
with the real, true and living, breathing founder

799
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:21,053
that cares about humanity.

800
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,117
- [Interviewer] Kanye West.

801
00:35:24,117 --> 00:35:25,054
(audience applauds)

802
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:25,928
Steven Smith.

803
00:35:25,928 --> 00:35:28,532
Thank you.

804
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:30,199
- [Kanye] Thank you.

805
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,343
- [Interviewer] We're just gonna work our way out and see.

806
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:37,450
- Did you actually have some questions?

807
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,310
- [Interviewer] No, that was it, yeah, good.

808
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,292
(laughter)
