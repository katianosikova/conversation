thanks for bringing us here man this

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,940
place is uh this place is spectacular

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,820
this is all same before this is the kind

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,960
of place that you fly over and you

9
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,340
wonder what's going on down there

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,980
because it's just doesn't you don't feel

13
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,720
like there's anything within you know a

15
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,820
thousand miles and we find ourselves in

17
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,490
this isolated place how did you find why

19
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,320
I mean why why I mean why here we

21
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,929
recorded the last album in Jackson Hole

23
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,890
and I just been looking to get a place

25
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:41,350
but I I've been looking to get a place

27
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:44,199
here and I was looking for multi a multi

29
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:47,250
thousand acre property and Jackson Hole

31
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:50,470
didn't have any properties available

33
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:56,220
over 500 acres because I was looking for

35
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:58,839
a place to set up the easy campus hmm so

37
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,820
we found out about Cody we came here and

39
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:02,559
when I first got to the ranch I was

41
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,489
expecting something really green because

43
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,670
that's what I was used to

45
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:11,020
hmm so I didn't like it when I first got

47
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:13,210
here and there yes but by the time I was

49
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,829
it was time to leave I loved it and I

51
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,679
was like wow these are actually the easy

53
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:23,799
tones right here it's actually that's

55
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:24,939
true it actually is the palette that I'm

57
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,710
thinking about that that makes me kind

59
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:30,189
of want to put the other jacket back on

61
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:32,409
my breath I wanna wear the fleece is

63
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:37,119
good you look good and the fleet just

65
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:40,240
feels like you know it says Jesus is

67
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,159
king palette oh yeah that makes it make

69
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,960
sense though you talked about and people

71
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,869
were at least 10 20 years now it's more

73
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,369
of a future well I want to ask you about

75
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:52,350
20 years from now you talk about yeezy

77
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:52,350
camp what is this place in 20 years

79
00:01:54,189 --> 00:02:08,560
I have some visions but the more that

81
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:12,640
I'm in service to God I just clear my

83
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,130
head and just wake up more empty every

85
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:21,340
day and then let and let God do the

87
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:23,819
driving and just use me as he may so you

89
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,989
you know you make plans and God laughs

91
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:30,760
so if I told you the plans I could tell

93
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:35,950
you what what would happen six months

95
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:39,069
from now at 20 years now so we're we're

97
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,049
building farms here because of the

99
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:45,750
climate and because the soil then I have

101
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:48,310
hydroponic cotton we hemp and we're

103
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,349
developing our own fabrics who are going

105
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,450
to go from seed to sow and farm-to-table

107
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:55,360
so we can see the entire process full

109
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,489
sustainability yes which is a concern

111
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,900
for all of us but but its present on

113
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:00,600
your mind the idea of a sustainable

115
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,850
future

117
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,220
we got a sustained right we do yeah and

119
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,739
for me I know where it's an interview

121
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,750
and we're doing talking but the reason

123
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,840
why I didn't want to say 20 years from

125
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,060
now I would say six months Naz is it's

127
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,139
really not about talking it's about

129
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,750
doing mm-hmm

131
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:25,989
so we are doing we are in the process

133
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,030
right now I can I could tell you what

135
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm doing anything else just yeah I got

137
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,260
a talk you know I think the original

139
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,910
plan was for you to use your interest in

141
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,769
architecture and and to build something

143
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,480
that that gave to the community and

145
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:39,840
expanded into the community from from

147
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,920
Calabasas and that didn't that didn't

149
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,660
manifest itself one reason or another

151
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,340
permits was that the reason why couldn't

153
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:49,239
happen out in California well it did

155
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:54,190
manifest that I was able to see it get

157
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:59,019
done mm-hmm but you know I was in

159
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:03,639
California building my domes and they

161
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:05,109
said my dome was ten feet too high right

163
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,759
then they tore it down that kind of

165
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,640
semantic but think about what they're

167
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,090
saying mmm

169
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:16,820
your dome it's too high we got to tear

171
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:18,350
it down so they came to me and said you

173
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,630
have to tear it down but before I even

175
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,090
had the opportunity now Maya this is

177
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,560
more my own 300 acre property before I

179
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,810
had the opportunity they already went to

181
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,760
press with it hmm to be liked and by the

183
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,710
way we're gonna show everyone tell

185
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,150
everyone that we're tearing down your

187
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,610
dough so what did that say to you at the

189
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,110
time beyond the actual actually detained

191
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,450
feet what does the 10 feet say to you

193
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:41,690
more than anything was the 10 extra

195
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:43,940
seconds that it takes to get a like back

197
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,540
when you put something on Instagram that

199
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:54,190
extra waiting time slow yessing people

201
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:58,490
and slowing people down is one of the

203
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:01,160
most popular forms of control how many

205
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,780
times have you had an idea and you just

207
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,510
get put in traffic through the

209
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,640
bureaucracy so I don't deal with the

211
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:12,110
traffic at all on any situation where

213
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,660
I'll just be sitting waiting I'm like

215
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,580
cuz its power versus force I'm not gonna

217
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,040
force anything I do what I have the

219
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,870
power to do uh-huh and if I have to

221
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,610
force it then it's probably not a

223
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,690
situation I need to be in when I come

225
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,460
here and I see the kind of world you're

227
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,710
living in here and the kind of

229
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,430
environment you that you will create six

231
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:32,660
months and Beyond I just wonder what and

233
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,430
and the transformation you're going

235
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,020
through as a human being what a city

237
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:41,060
like our life feels like when you go

239
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:43,250
back it feels a bit cramped for my mind

241
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,470
when you drove here you didn't see a lot

243
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:48,290
of extra noise it was the road there was

245
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,390
nothing and then just God yeah yeah I

247
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,350
mean when you see all of the the

249
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:57,289
billboards the the traffic billboards

251
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,390
and I say traffic I'm talking about the

253
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:06,530
billboards are actually sex trafficking

255
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:08,330
because if a guy is arguing with his

257
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,940
girl or something that went through

259
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,220
something with his wife and on one side

261
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:17,300
of the street there's a billboard for

263
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:20,960
spirits just alcohol another side it's

265
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,290
called this number where it's a picture

267
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,180
of

269
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:26,270
a woman on a billboard says come to the

271
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,280
strip club yeah and he goes and spend

273
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,400
some money just to sit down and have

275
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,870
someone to talk to him at the end of the

277
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,020
night when they close up the club they

279
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,780
say how much traffic did we have so

281
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,370
there's all different layers to traffic

283
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:48,950
in like for me

285
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:51,800
playboy was my gateway and to full-on

287
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:57,200
pornography addiction my dad had a

289
00:06:51,800 --> 00:07:02,030
playboy left out at age five and it's

291
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:05,480
affected almost every choice I made for

293
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:10,100
the rest of my life mmm from age five to

295
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:15,200
now having to kick the habit and it just

297
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:19,040
presents itself in the open like it's

299
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,110
okay and I stand up and say you know

301
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,510
it's not okay you must be incredibly

303
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,270
aware now that you've got to a point

305
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,760
where you are actively turning your back

307
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,250
on the coping mechanisms that you've

309
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,930
been using throughout your life right in

311
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,780
order to function from that moment in

313
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,610
time through to when did you first start

315
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,130
to acknowledge the idea of being born

317
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,410
again and and absorbing your faith Holt

319
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,380
like completely not just as a Christian

321
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,880
walking through society but actually

323
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,930
like in servitude when was that

325
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:55,940
approximately it's like approximately

327
00:07:49,930 --> 00:08:00,230
April okay was after Coachella yeah you

329
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:02,930
know yeah God was using me and it lined

331
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,930
up amazing like literally the Sunday was

333
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,010
Easter Sunday yeah but I remember when

335
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,140
the hare died

337
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,850
you know it was placed on my head that

339
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,550
morning before Coachella and then hit my

341
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,980
head and it felt cold hmm and I didn't

343
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,960
like it I had an aversion to it and then

345
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,760
when the guy was dying it I didn't even

347
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,490
like how I came out I had like too much

349
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,010
white in the tone it was like purple and

351
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,440
white and I was like I don't like this

353
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:31,870
but I had already planned to have like

355
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,460
this purple you know outfit and this

357
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:37,399
purple hair dye and you know

359
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:41,419
I wouldn't have the I wouldn't have the

361
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:44,839
time to sit and do anything you know

363
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:46,970
like that now because I'm you know using

365
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,620
my mind to build what we're building

367
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,779
with farming what we're building we're

369
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,760
bringing manufacturing back to the

371
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:56,270
states within the next two years

373
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,130
Easy's you know we're gonna bring them

375
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,649
back to the states we're creating

377
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:05,350
factories where we have an injection

379
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:10,310
molded shoes we're gonna be hiring

381
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:14,260
people through the prison reform I don't

383
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:17,060
like to say the word system but

385
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:20,089
second-chance people hmm

387
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,279
and just you know people gave up on

389
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:25,190
manufacturer um I wanna I'm talking

391
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:28,010
about the purple hair for a second oh

393
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,899
but then I want to jump into how we had

395
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,209
given up on manufacturing and said let's

397
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:33,860
just like manufacturers overseas because

399
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:36,649
it seemed like it was what was easier

401
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,730
yeah and for me as a founder it's really

403
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:44,660
important to bring these jobs you know

405
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,490
back to back to America why I mean what

407
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,720
specifically what what affected you that

409
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:53,150
that part of the process of building

411
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:59,990
easy offshore let's start creatively I

413
00:09:53,150 --> 00:10:02,660
had this idea for a new boot that we did

415
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,610
and actually the design that we did is

417
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,680
very similar to something that we now

419
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,270
just saw in a Balenciaga show so a lot

421
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,190
of times me and Tim that the head

423
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:13,250
designer blintz Yaga will have similar

425
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:17,240
ideas thinking we did the 700 they did

427
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:19,779
the triple-s at the similar time so you

429
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,089
know I built a factory in Canoga

431
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:28,339
California so we wouldn't have to go to

433
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:29,870
the factories in China but 30% of the

435
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:33,260
machines were still in storage and it

437
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,940
was never built all the way to not have

439
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,160
to go to China so the team went to China

441
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,920
they're working on this boot I call it

443
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,520
the motorcycle boot right now and it's

445
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,260
stuck in customs so I still haven't seen

447
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,660
I said do we have a picture of it or we

449
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,680
don't have a picture of it whereas when

451
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,870
I have ly

453
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,760
this gentleman Caesar that works in our

455
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,280
office will have a idea and he's just

457
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,380
pulling the phone together and moulding

459
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,200
it right there I mean by the end of the

461
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:04,040
day you get a physical idea of what once

463
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,190
was a Photoshop so for us to be able to

465
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:11,030
wrap it prototype we have to wrap your

467
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:16,010
prototype even the what we're doing with

469
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:19,070
the way spaces are you know it's like

471
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:22,220
we've been stuck in a loop and we got to

473
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:24,080
break the loop and that's one of the

475
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,840
reasons why I took the denim jacket off

477
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:31,130
even though I love the the color and put

479
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:33,650
on this polar fleece because the idea is

481
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,850
more in the future than the fabrics

483
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,060
we're looking at the fabrics are we

485
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,460
gonna use traditional cotton cotton or

487
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:43,580
are we using the polar fleece what

489
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,940
impact does the dye have and we're

491
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,190
studying if we can control the color

493
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,750
from the seed and that's when you go

495
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:54,710
seed to sow because a lot of times you

497
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:58,190
have a separate cotton factory and then

499
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:00,440
they send it out to be cut then it gets

501
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:04,640
sent back to the cotton factory then it

503
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:06,350
gets sent to die and we've been talking

505
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,950
about things like screen printing to

507
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,510
apply color or dipping it in a different

509
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:15,380
way because we're just looking like

511
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:16,400
nylon is a five-story building so when

513
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,570
we're going to see to someone I'm

515
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,370
looking because I like the Nile when we

517
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,680
have nylon in here I'm saying oh wow we

519
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,330
need to we got to have fabrics that

521
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,440
don't take five story buildings I was

523
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,670
gonna psyche Enoch before we were

525
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,840
talking started filming I was talking

527
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,830
about how I wanna get your opinion on

529
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,470
why it's important to bring

531
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,700
manufacturing back to the states I mean

533
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,990
I've only been here four or five years

535
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,400
but I mean I know that it's important to

537
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,420
the country that there are jobs here and

539
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,530
that there are things happening in them

541
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,730
within the country within the space of

543
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,870
the country I mean you know from my

545
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,970
point of view I know that there is a

547
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:44,330
huge amount of deliberation over

549
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,950
manufacturing and and and conditions and

551
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,290
wages and all sorts of things offshore

553
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,670
and you know I know from people from

555
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,930
talking to people in fashion talking to

557
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,730
people in all kinds of industries that

559
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:56,330
there's a desire to control that more to

561
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,920
be more in control of how people are

563
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,470
treated and how things are made I mean

565
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,089
it's really about control we have to be

567
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:06,399
in control

569
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:09,709
of our own minds of our own food our

571
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,269
health and our families that's what's

573
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:12,439
gonna say well you know when I arrived I

575
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:15,439
said I didn't know whether this was you

577
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:16,939
know 3000 years with a and 3,000 years

579
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:18,139
in the past or 3,000 years in the future

581
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:20,149
being on this ranch because it's so

583
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,439
isolated and and and really are in the

585
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:22,759
elements apart from this cozy

587
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:23,899
environment we're in the elements right

589
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:27,199
here it's just been planted in the

591
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:28,430
middle of the space and and it sounds to

593
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:29,809
me like you want to go back to go

595
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,699
forward like you want to go back and use

597
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:34,430
some of these techniques and these ideas

599
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:37,129
in order to roll is dismantle it

601
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:40,610
ultimately here like Rome is the is the

603
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:42,920
true Silicon Valley of humanity a lot of

605
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,870
the ideas and things that we need yeah

607
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,999
I've been are from thousands and

609
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,879
thousands years ago there's like what do

611
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:53,569
we need for our as laws hierarchy of

613
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:55,910
neat art what is mmm what our personal

615
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:58,249
needs as a human being and what we need

617
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,899
the most is each other

619
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:01,519
mm-hmm that's why we gather together

621
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,800
just like the antelopes that are running

623
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,329
out there hmm we gather together and

625
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:10,579
what is the best form of each other

627
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:14,240
family to keep our families close huh

629
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:16,279
but cities have been designed to create

631
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,790
more problems that can create more

633
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:23,209
industries so it's designed that your

635
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:26,329
job is 45 minutes away so that you can

637
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:28,999
spend time and traffic so that the cars

639
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:32,449
have more wear and tear and and spend

641
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:35,870
more gas and take more gas but to think

643
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:39,610
of communities where the church is in

645
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:43,370
the center of the community and then

647
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:46,879
then the school cafeterias sustainable

649
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:50,179
gardening and homes this is the concept

651
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:53,149
that I have this is what we this is what

653
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:55,220
me and Rick Fox went to the Bahamas as

655
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:58,809
we're working on hurricane proof homes

657
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,040
right now we're thinking of how to

659
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:02,480
organize the amount of wind that's

661
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,040
coming through yeah this house is gonna

663
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,689
be way more that I put on here you know

665
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,120
yeah yeah so I mean this is not a

667
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:11,209
hurricane obviously nobody whips through

669
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,709
yeah and one of when I was creating the

671
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,730
energy to write I mean that's what he

673
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:16,139
was saying before I mean it's it may

675
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,670
the elements give you what you need is

677
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,769
what you're saying yeah God gives us

679
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:24,660
everything that we need what I love

681
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:27,209
about being Christian is I've always

683
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:30,779
been an innovator but it always seemed

685
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:33,209
like all the innovators working for I

687
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:35,459
don't know and ran I heard the term or

689
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:37,500
something like these ideas that there is

691
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:40,410
no God all this and it's just working

693
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:45,690
for the valuation of a company as

695
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:47,790
opposed to working for the rebirth or is

697
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:52,199
that a rebirth I might not find the

699
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:55,889
right word but working for a renewal of

701
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:59,699
the planet and a humility and humanity

703
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:02,279
to understand that we will not destroy

705
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:04,050
the earth we could destroy the resources

707
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,699
we can destroy ourselves and we destroy

709
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,300
ourselves and then the earth goes off

711
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,000
sure

713
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,709
so regardless of what's happening at

715
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,959
Wall Street and what's happening at the

717
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:18,120
board at the you know with with trade

719
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:22,380
and what's happening a Pangaea type

721
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,029
mentality un coming together one thing

723
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,209
no matter what side you're on you're

725
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:29,459
considered to be a bad guy a good guy

727
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:31,889
everybody wants a similar thing and

729
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:34,740
that's for the world to be better for

731
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:37,560
their children huh so someone's fighting

733
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:41,220
in a war they want the world to be

735
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:44,220
better folks their children and what

737
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:47,850
we're not realizing being all God's

739
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:51,720
creation is we have so much more in

741
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:53,550
common than we think I think there's

743
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,829
something planning at us this idea of

745
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,620
you know human nature even stuff that I

747
00:16:55,829 --> 00:17:00,750
was saying oh I saw in Silicon Valley

749
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,550
but this guy was like I don't want the

751
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:07,799
world to be fixed if I if I'm not the

753
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:09,510
one fixing it but you know we do we

755
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,910
always put ourselves right right in the

757
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,949
center of trying to solve things but I

759
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:16,500
often think that as society we lack

761
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,870
direction in the unity needed to do it

763
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,520
as one right we don't always have to be

765
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:23,520
the one that does it you know this

767
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:27,199
interview alone yeah might do it I could

769
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,199
be in there and you know

771
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:33,150
have these ideas of civil engineering

773
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:38,280
and using aqueducts and sustainable

775
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:39,780
gardening and farming but there's people

777
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,340
out there they're gonna see this and

779
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,070
they're like they're gonna come to the

781
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,510
table and say you know I've done I've

783
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,860
studied this for 10 years I've studied

785
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,070
this for 10 years I've studied this for

787
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,080
10 years and it's something where

789
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:54,420
everybody all the fortune 500 companies

791
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,660
all the founders have to come to the

793
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,370
table and say this is what we want we

795
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,300
were here in 2012 it's a difference

797
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:05,160
between founders yeah and stockholders

799
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:09,480
yeah what would you say the difference

801
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:11,640
is well the founder has the ultimate

803
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,930
responsibility for the legacy at hand

805
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,610
the stockholder has the ultimate

807
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,930
responsibility for the money and the

809
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,390
power and the business of the money in

811
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,280
the moment yeah so you got a look look

813
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,990
he'd like Gary from Restoration Hardware

815
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,910
they try to kick him out of his company

817
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,290
yeah and it was as legacy didn't match

819
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,910
up with the with the with the with the

821
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,820
with the power you know with the the

823
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,330
money in the and they had had to bring

825
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,320
him back

827
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,400
that's the thing with the founder

829
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,830
founders are special bro

831
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,470

00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,520

00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,210
interview give me a call four years ago

847
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,770

849
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,480
was and this is the fun this is how much

851
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,830
you've changed over four years four

853
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,250

different is a different mission and

871
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:20,250
that required you to commit whole like

873
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,810
wholesale to your faith not just as I am

875
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,720
a Christian but also know who my

877
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:31,170
favorite founder is so Jack Dorsey right

879
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:34,740
why just incredibly smart visionary

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,720
mm-hmm he created a bank on his third

883
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,390
company at one company it fell second

new arm like st. arm that division the

891
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:49,420
bank that allows people to buy stock in

893
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,650
companies as big as I'm gonna say his

895
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,750
company I don't know how to say today

897
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:55,120
but it's the one that calls 314,000

899
00:19:52,750 --> 00:20:00,190
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Jack

901
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:03,190
Dorsey's created an app where someone

903
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:05,410
can buy into that stock at $1 actually

905
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,050
I'm not saying that that is not possible

907
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,820
somewhere on the stock market huh I'm

909
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:12,370
just saying he created the app and that

911
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,950
allows everyone to be invested to be

913
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,570
invested I mean that's just one of the

915
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:21,000
things he's did one of the things that

917
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:25,840
he did is he he wanted to invest in me

919
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,650
early and he never he never tried to Sun

921
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,330
me a lot of times I would go out and

923
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:33,970
meet with people in Silicon Valley and

925
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,890
it was really like the first episode of

927
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,900
Silicon Valley where Kid Rock is like

929
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,490
young love Kid Rock and the very next

931
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:45,850
conversation is yo that's cute right

933
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:47,290
he's the brokest person here so you

935
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,640
imagine lies you would trivialize you

937
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,590
thought trivialized in that experience

939
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,700
as an entertainer trying to play trying

941
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:58,930
to play tick absolutely and you know now

943
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:02,020
that I'm in service to Christ my job is

945
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,940
to spread the gospel mm-hmm to let

947
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,250
people know what Jesus has done for me

949
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,200
you know I've spread it a lot of things

951
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,600
I there was a time I was letting you

953
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,120
know what high fashion had done for me I

955
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,770
was letting you know what the Hennessy

957
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,330
had done for me I was letting you know

959
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,690
all these things but now I'm letting you

961
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:26,530
know what Jesus has done for me and in

963
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:30,420
that I'm no longer I'm no longer a slave

965
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:34,990
I'm a son now son of God I'm free

967
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:36,070
through to Christ I'm thinking of

969
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,160
something I want to say I allow

971
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:45,700
Christian innovator when you think about

973
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:51,650
the church because it has to stand on

975
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:55,160
the word so hard it loves to

977
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:58,780
be extra traditional to the point of

979
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:01,370
blocking innovation so when we started

981
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,070
Sunday service we were able to be free

983
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,660
where people were in doubt of it and

985
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:08,059
questioned some people slow in question

987
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,260
now saying it's not a church you can't

989
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:09,980
call it a church because you'll have a

991
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,340
pastor

993
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:17,840
all of these things is it a choice well

995
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:19,190
we have a pastor now so but this is a

997
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,380
church like I mean is that is that kind

999
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,600
of the ultimate compliment for you that

1001
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:27,080
Sunday service is a church well let's

1003
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:31,730
ask let's ask North West she thinks we

1005
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:36,280
based our design loosely not loosely

1007
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:36,280
okay we saw out we saw Rob James Terrell

1009
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,160
[Laughter]

1011
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:46,400
he's a good one yeah so we and I have

1013
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,280
the utmost respect he's unreal for

1015
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,250
Ortega also the head is Zara because I

1017
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,050
would like to saw Raja Rock right I want

1019
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:57,920
as I rob their infrastructure right and

1021
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:59,720
the way their office environment so the

1023
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,840
the the church that we did I was you

1025
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:06,320
know slightly embarrassed to show James

1027
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,720
that we had copied his his uh his

1029
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,610
circular space yeah and it didn't have

1031
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,200
an oculus at the top so we just copy the

1033
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,690
way he did the benches right he did some

1035
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,070
lights but the lights would move slow

1037
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:19,220
and sometimes it looked like doesn't

1039
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,929
make yet yeah so what is your it's like

1041
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:25,010
a big sort of like rounded teepee type

1043
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:27,200
environment is yeah so I showed you know

1045
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:31,190
North a picture of a James Turrell

1047
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:35,240
structure that I loved and she said that

1049
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:39,050
looks like Church huh that's what church

1051
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,540
looks like to north and north is you

1053
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:44,240
know she was last night just actually

1055
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,890
crying about when she couldn't go to

1057
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,630
church when it would be out of town and

1059
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,150
she'd be at school and she was like

1061
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:53,030
church needs to be here every Sunday

1063
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,730
so now we'll only move the church mostly

1065
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:58,880
on Friday have only moved the choir

1067
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:02,150
mostly on Friday and throughout the week

1069
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,980
but we'll always have it at home because

1071
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,150
church does need to be a place that

1073
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,160
people know

1075
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:09,050
they can go to and they don't have to

1077
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,320
hop on a flight and chase it down and

1079
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:16,610
that's what is a part of what I think

1081
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,710
makes it a church another thing is when

1083
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,690
North talks about church she says I'm

1085
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:23,030
gonna bring my friends here and I'm

1087
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,800
gonna dance tell me someone that you

1089
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,950
know that's in our age group that

1091
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,410
they're most positive memory of their

1093
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,630
childhood or one of them equally was

1095
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:35,660
going to church where people are like I

1097
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,750
want to go to church and what do you

1099
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:42,440
think that is sitting in those pews the

1101
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:45,170
tradition the four walls God doesn't

1103
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:49,390
exist only in four walls God is

1105
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:52,730
everything and everywhere so Christian

1107
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:55,400
innovation Christian innovators that's

1109
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,950
the net that we're casting for the

1111
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,840
organization that we have now looking

1113
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:03,740

1115
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,600
Avena wrap up preacher well no longer

1119
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,230

1121
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,790
interesting interesting so let me ask

1123
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,570
you this real quick cuz I because I want

1125
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,270
to go here for a minute

1127
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,610
yeah North's all in you're raising your

1129
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,740
family with in this environment now and

1131
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:21,770
they support you and they Bend and

1133
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:24,200
they're believing Kim as well yes right

1135
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:27,200
so what about like say you're making

1137
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,000
this album what about those who are

1139
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,830
talented who bring something special to

1141
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,720
the table who are creative who inspire

1143
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,670
you in that regard but not necessarily

1145
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,170
worshipping at the altar how's your

1147
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,320
relationship with them changed because

1149
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:42,980
you're so driven by your faith now

1151
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:46,280
they're still here mm-hmm I believe that

1153
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:52,070
was King David now I'm not a theologian

1155
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:54,410
I'm a recent convert so I just wanted to

1157
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,900
say that before I start sure quoting or

1159
00:25:54,410 --> 00:26:01,550
misquoting structure so yeah yeah you're

1161
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:03,710
on a journey yes so yeah that was this

1163
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:06,320
journey of this album you know there was

1165
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:10,300
times where I was asking people to fast

1167
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,800
during the album I was asking people to

1169
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,870
this is gonna be radical when I'm about

1171
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,540
to say I know this is we can look at it

1173
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:18,650
edit this time was where I was asking

1175
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,140
people to

1177
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,340
now have premarital sex while they were

1179
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,440
working on an album huh

1181
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,660
I know that's one with a shady room we

1183
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,059
like what you mean don't have premarital

1185
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:41,059
sex you better turn that Magda style you

1187
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:43,370
know right now so that but seriously

1189
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:45,740
there's time so I was you know this time

1191
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:49,160
so I went to people that were working on

1193
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:51,920
other projects and said could you just

1195
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,179
work and focus on this and not just

1197
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,590
because you needed their attention but

1199
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,790
because it wasn't in keeping with the

1201
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,230
spirit of what you were making you

1203
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,970
thought that it was at odds what they

1205
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,340
were working on yeah I thought it would

1207
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,550
be it would tarnish the experience yeah

1209
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:06,800
I thought if we could all focus and fast

1211
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,230
I mean it's known when people pray

1213
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,730
together families are pray together stay

1215
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:16,600
together when people pray together and

1217
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:20,390
fast together the the power is is

1219
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:23,270
increased so so I had some things were

1221
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,670
theories of recent converts they go in

1223
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:30,020
and you know we're a lot of times the

1225
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:35,120
most fire-and-brimstone else judgmental

1227
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:38,179
yeah because we don't know what - we

1229
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,179
don't everything that we did was of and

1231
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:42,679
that for God so we have to the reaction

1233
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:44,600
to a degree isn't it it's a reaction of

1235
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,420
what you've left behind so ya feel like

1237
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,390
you must commit 1000% to something in

1239
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,130
order to leave behind that was the

1241
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,630
environment you can't tell other people

1243
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,120
that are around that they need to be

1245
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:59,150
committed 1,000% and that's the thing

1247
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,700
but God was patient and my family was

1249
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:03,679
patient for me when they when they were

1251
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,420
praying for me you know when they saw me

1253
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,550
yeah at the pornhub Awards there's

1255
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,460
family members they couldn't tell me not

1257
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:12,380
to do it all they could do was pray yeah

1259
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,630
and be patient and it had to happen in

1261
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,450
God's time so for me when I have people

1263
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:19,610
around who I would like them to be where

1265
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm at in my journey this time so all I

1267
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,000
could do is pray and be patient guys

1269
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,830
gonna only be in God's time but you've

1271
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,330
lived a well-documented life filled with

1273
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,160
temptation and it's been it's all

1275
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,330
throughout your records and all

1277
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,220
throughout your music and it's been

1279
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,060
quoted and what's your relationship with

1281
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,790
temptation

1283
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,470
now how do you process that are you able

1285
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:38,420
once you find God to the degree you have

1287
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:42,650
to just switch that off is that possible

1289
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:44,750
I think when people have been addicted

1291
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,950
to something like if you ask somebody

1293
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:50,980
that's a drug addict it's like you say

1295
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:54,290
are you still addicted

1297
00:28:50,980 --> 00:29:00,320
well yeah you turn it off actually like

1299
00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:03,560
with God I've been able to beat things

1301
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,500
that had a full control of me things

1303
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:09,350
that you know that that played way that

1305
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,570
I found when I was five years old was

1307
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:14,240
written all over the moment when I was

1309
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:16,370
at the MTV Awards with the timberlands

1311
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,070
the ball mine jeans before people's

1313
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:23,270
rocket ball my jeans and the Hennessy

1315
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:26,030
bottle it's like that was such a script

1317
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:30,040
out of a rock star's life my mom had

1319
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:33,680
passed a year before and I said you know

1321
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:37,990
some people drown themselves in drugs

1323
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:42,160
and I drowned myself in my addiction mmm

1325
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,160
which was what sex

1327
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:52,899
and that's what drove the ego to fit the

1329
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:59,080
ego I mean that was part of feeding the

1331
00:29:52,899 --> 00:30:02,350
ego money clothes cars accolades the

1333
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:06,610
advent of social media a Twitter account

1335
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:08,289
mm-hmm of paparazzi photos go on to

1337
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,940
Paris Fashion Week all of that it's

1339
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:11,740
overwhelming I mean we need to clear

1341
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,870
your mind to the degree you are now and

1343
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,429
you sit out here in Wyoming making music

1345
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,659
which is spiritually fulfilling to you

1347
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:18,580
and hopefully to millions of other

1349
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:21,909
people you know what that was not just

1351
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:25,919
addicted to sex I was also addicted to

1353
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:28,870
inspiration but there's only one you

1355
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,669
know I was thank God they both serving

1357
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,840
the same purpose to some degree and I

1359
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:32,470
mean this let me let me qualify that

1361
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,019
statement

1363
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,120
okay addiction be it six drugs alcohol

1365
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:38,649
is a coping mechanism that is designed

1367
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,059
to fill a space in you that can't be

1369
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:42,669
filled an insatiable hole right

1371
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:44,470
requiring more and more isn't use it

1373
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:46,509
inspiration maybe I'm meaning more

1375
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:48,610
ambition isn't that doing the same thing

1377
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:49,990
then well they said that you know a lot

1379
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:56,549
of successful men had a high sex drive

1381
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:56,549
right the who said that you know they

1383
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,179
yeah yeah so but when I meant by

1385
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:11,590
addicted to inspiration yeah it could be

1387
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:18,279
the sex could be an inspiration but also

1389
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:20,649
just a design image you know a jacket

1391
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:24,519
that I wanted to design a car image a

1393
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:27,490

I didn't have to there's a balance of

1435
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:48,119
family and calling that I specifically

1437
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:51,149
have I have to protect and take care of

1439
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:54,509
my family and make sure what the power

1441
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:56,309
that God has put in my hands that I do

1443
00:32:54,509 --> 00:33:04,080
everything that I can

1445
00:32:56,309 --> 00:33:10,320
as the father to provide the best chance

1447
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:14,969
at them being the maximum success that

1449
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,769
they can be no that was a very but

1451
00:33:14,969 --> 00:33:18,719
specifically thoughtful answer yeah

1453
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:22,619
because I just say normal life no I just

1455
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:23,940
say no I was very jealous oh oh and I

1457
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:25,409
get that I and I said as a father

1459
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,179
because they also have a mother that's

1461
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:28,799
right so it's the barrel and it's all

1463
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:30,389
about the fourth house it's about the

1465
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,729
environment that you create ultimately

1467
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:36,739
they're learning right yeah and also the

1469
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:42,589
environment of because of my position in

1471
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:45,629
the world the environment that I inform

1473
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:48,359
for other people you know we've informed

1475
00:33:45,629 --> 00:33:50,690
a successful celebrity marriage a

1477
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:54,779
successful interracial marriage where

1479
00:33:50,690 --> 00:34:00,239
the husband was the darker color inside

1481
00:33:54,779 --> 00:34:05,309
of America we we've informed some things

1483
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:09,929
that I I wasn't as into now where you

1485
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:13,220
know I literally was up there trying to

1487
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:15,720
have my daughter out dress Rihanna

1489
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,129
it sound crazy when you say it out loud

1491
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,839
but if you really think about is like

1493
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:23,609
his daughter was walking around with a

1495
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:26,579
slip dress I the culture was my god

1497
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:27,899
mm-hmm because and this was documented

1499
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:30,510
this was documented in Keeping Up with

1501
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:32,760
the Kardashians and in a scene really

1503
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:34,859
interesting to watch the dynamic of you

1505
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,440
and Kim where she ultimately said you

1507
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:39,559
were complicit in this experience yeah

1509
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,270
and now you're asking me to change and

1511
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:43,470
away from the cameras that's that's

1513
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,900
another example of what you're talking

1515
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,510
about is

1517
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:48,340
not I would I always had a bit of a

1519
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,030
version of paparazzi which has been

1521
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:54,190
documented

1523
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:57,580
I'm also and have also had a aversion to

1525
00:34:54,190 --> 00:35:00,700
cameras being on at all times there's a

1527
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:03,280
balance of when we have to be closed on

1529
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:07,570
Sunday but the idea I was gonna say is

1531
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:11,380
that I thought I was the God of culture

1533
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:16,410
but really culture was my god and who

1535
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:19,300
invented the culture the culture is

1537
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:23,590
cultivated by who so if you were to

1539
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:25,330
think what is the culture today what are

1541
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:31,390
some of the major things that it

1543
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:36,240
includes and all of the major points of

1545
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:40,330
what might make the culture the culture

1547
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:46,150
bowing I mean taking a knee at a

1549
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:50,260
football game wearing you know expensive

1551
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:53,550
clothes rapping about just rap period

1553
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:56,080
making money from rap making money from

1555
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:57,430
basketball before I get to my point can

1557
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:01,390
we name some other things that you say

1559
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:03,340
are part of culture buying jewelry what

1561
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:06,160
are some of the other things that we see

1563
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:09,280
on the culture using social media as a

1565
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,350
very major part of the culture to be

1567
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,530
down with or with the culture you have

1569
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:16,840
to use social media right what other

1571
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:19,540
things okay now let me just get to my

1573
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:23,530
point right now none of these things

1575
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,720
that you need to be involved in in order

1577
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:33,480
to be down with the culture are owned by

1579
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:33,480
by people so who designed the culture

1581
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:40,850
a lot of people would argue that you are

1583
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:44,210
instrumental in driving the culture and

1585
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:47,780
you own your own companies that you have

1587
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:49,940
inspired that change what it's an

1589
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,020
inspired now but did you know that this

1591
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,770
is where I was going with it when I

1593
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:57,970
named all those things you didn't name

1595
00:36:54,770 --> 00:37:00,920
yourself you didn't name yourself and

1597
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:03,650
yeah it's a very valid point mm-hmm I

1599
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,260
think that's changing I think that

1601
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:09,260
culture is very squarely going into the

1603
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:13,670
hands and the influence now of the mute

1605
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:17,210
the new founders I mean when Chad said

1607
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:19,330
don't sign anything right his tour was

1609
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:22,190
canceled like the next week mm-hmm

1611
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,580
spiritual warfare okay let's talk about

1613
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:27,050
that

1615
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:30,980
you say it and God is changing God is

1617
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:35,420
using me God is using me to show off

1619
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:37,730
I believe he like you know God is is

1621
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,460
similar to he's saying he wanted the

1623
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:43,070
loudest voice and the and the the one

1625
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,750
who made the most noise timid to make

1627
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,620
the most impact yeah he wanted to show

1629
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:52,190
off he's like Matt now let me take this

1631
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:55,700
let me take this never kanessa type

1633
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:58,820
character Nebuchadnezzar was the king

1635
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:01,130
was it is it Babylon mm-hmm not

1637
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:03,860
Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon

1639
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:06,650
and he looked at his entire kingdom and

1641
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:08,540
said I did this and God said Oh real you

1643
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:10,250
did this it sounds kind of similar right

1645
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,250
I'm standing on the tip of the mountain

1647
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:16,430
talking about Jesus say it's right I did

1649
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:18,020
this I'm a god now I'm a God and I could

1651
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:21,440
talk to Jesus at the end of my show I

1653
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:22,850
had a guy dressed up as Jesus at the end

1655
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,910
of my show standing on a huge mountain

1657
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:28,100
yeah that's all and that huge mountain

1659
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:31,090
first why they make any money off the

1661
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:34,940
tour I'm lugging a mountain around and

1663
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:37,820
God said okay never kanessa was

1665
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:41,180
diagnosed with bipolar disorder he was

1667
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:43,250
and he was still King so not only was I

1669
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:47,160
diagnosed with mental illness the mental

1671
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:51,960
illness is something that was used

1673
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:54,390
to take my dome down by 10 feet to wash

1675
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,070
me out to control me

1677
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:58,500
let me tell you one are you saying that

1679
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,880
they tore it down because it was based

1681
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,460
on the fact that they consider what you

1683
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,990
were doing to be part of to be crazy no

1685
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,000
that's not what I'm saying but I see

1687
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:09,390
that you took in that way no I was just

1689
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,790
comparing on my dome and saying this guy

1691
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:15,240
that can go up to the telethon this guy

1693
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:18,750
that that we can cancel him off a radio

1695
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,640
and still 20,000 kids come to see him

1697
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,710
and he is completely not played by the

1699
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,630
rules of the system and still the most

1701
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:27,840
relevant we could take him off the time

1703
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:30,390
cover we could do no covers on them on

1705
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,700
purpose on purpose we could just take

1707
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:37,040
away press no publicist Vic do that and

1709
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:40,380
he still has the number one searched

1711
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:45,080
brand on the planet meaning like number

1713
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:47,280
one GZ number two or flight number three

1715
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,320
adidas and then the other three is like

1717
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,580
Adidas Nike and Louie Vuitton I don't

1719
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,880
know which one was which one was which

1721
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,450
but the number one was easy and all the

1723
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,850
other ones

1725
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:58,770
I'm closely associated with in some way

1727
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:00,810
every one of these guys that our

1729
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,510
founders now have to look me I to I

1731
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:05,250
every founder on the planet there will

1733
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:09,420
be a time while will be president of the

1735
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:12,950
United States and I will remember I will

1737
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,870
forgive but I will remember any founder

1739
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:19,470
that didn't have the capacity to

1741
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:21,210
understand culturally what we were doing

1743
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,950
interesting tone though like I will

1745
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,450
forgive and I will remember is kind of

1747
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:28,950
like it's sort of like a forgiving

1749
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:31,380
threatening hybrid what Oh what I'm

1751
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:33,750
supposed to forget no you said you'll

1753
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,460
forgive but what does remember mean if

1755
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,080
you forgive isn't forgiveness if you

1757
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,440
forgive yourself for the life you lived

1759
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,060
up until six seven months ago do you

1761
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,580
still remember all the things you always

1763
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:46,470
remember every meeting and interaction

1765
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,240
I've had with Jack Dorsey and I will

1767
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,220
always remember my meetings and

1769
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,600
interactions with Mark Zuckerberg and

1771
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:57,320
they've been completely different

1773
00:40:51,600 --> 00:41:00,090
mm-hm with social media people are

1775
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,110
brainwashed by a people are addicted to

1777
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,300
it is they

1779
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,950
modern-day cigarettes when cigarettes

1781
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,740
first came out and Edward Bernays

1783
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:10,380
created the created the torches of

1785
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,900
freedom March to get women to feel

1787
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,120
empowered yep by smoking cigarettes this

1789
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:19,020
is from center yourself and it shows

1791
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:23,610
that Edward Bernays was Freud's cousin

1793
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:25,470
so you know I don't know if I should

1795
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:27,660
even even talk anymore it's like you

1797
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:30,390
gotta leave I mean so much more to ask

1799
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,620
you I just thought the waving is so much

1801
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,450
more now see it might be five more years

1803
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,860
where I get it you might be president by

1805
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,210
the time I speak to you next yeah we're

1807
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,100
I'm gonna be on the on the on the

1809
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,960
picking order when you're president you

1811
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,490
are you write down no we'll do our

1813
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,660
interview we'll do an interview I don't

1815
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,770
do a lot of interviews anyway you

1817
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,180
Donna's gonna see you again I'll

1819
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:50,550
probably do more interviews when I'm

1821
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:53,040
president 2024 is still thing it's still

1823
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,390
that's the that's the timeframe we're

1825
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,820
working on you're working on some things

1827
00:41:54,390 --> 00:42:01,440
right now so yeah the what I'm saying is

1829
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:05,430
people are addicted to social media

1831
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,280
people invest more into a photo on

1833
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:11,490
social media than they invest into real

1835
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,880
life one of the reasons why I came to

1837
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:16,410
this ranch is to get outside anyone

1839
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,560
that's in a corporate environment black

1841
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:22,760
or white there's bureaucracy at every

1843
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:25,470
level there's there there's rivalries on

1845
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,170
teams at every level there's rivalries

1847
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:30,930
with coaches with owners with

1849
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:35,790
stockholders with founders and everybody

1851
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:37,530
goes home to their families and they

1853
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:40,980
want their their sons and their

1855
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:42,600
daughters to be a successful as them if

1857
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,570
not better you know we're all people

1859
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,820
yeah so this is it to to point fingers

1861
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:50,280
and say this person is doing good and

1863
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:55,770
this person is doing bad you know I'm

1865
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:58,650
just giving you a flat opinion on what I

1867
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:01,710
currently see and what I feel and the

1869
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:04,650
pain that I have in my life I suffer I

1871
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:06,900
suffer and I appreciate the suffering

1873
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:09,690
because it's just we can just feel a

1875
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:14,970
little bit of what Jesus felt when we

1877
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:19,710
suffer but social media makes me suffer

1879
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:21,980
I suffer from that and by me saying this

1881
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:25,260
out loud I'm sure that there's other

1883
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:28,110
married men that suffer in a similar way

1885
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:31,070
that are happy to hear me say oh yeah

1887
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:37,560
I'm suffering well I just married men

1889
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:41,760
because social media prompts women in

1891
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,110
particular to put out content that they

1893
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,180
wouldn't have put out when I sent

1895
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:47,700
referring to your sex addiction yeah

1897
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:50,040
would not yeah it definitely could deal

1899
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:52,740
with my addictions but when I was

1901
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,650
younger and I wanted to see something

1903
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:57,390
like that I had to you know pay someone

1905
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:01,380
that was older to go to 7-eleven and buy

1907
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:03,150
it now I got friends they got have kids

1909
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,370
that aren't just out of grandmas school

1911
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,970
in high school that it's completely

1913
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:09,180
available

1915
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:11,670
there is no NSFW I'll load up right now

1917
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:14,070
on this computer and I'll load up some

1919
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:18,630
things and you'll be like should that be

1921
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:21,690
NSFW or not is it just covering just a

1923
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:29,000
bit of it and you know there's people as

1925
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:34,050
a god-fearing merry Christian innovator

1927
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:37,140
billionaire founder no one's gonna take

1929
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:38,910
my opinion away from me I've been given

1931
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,890
my opinion my whole career I didn't kill

1933
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:44,130
my career how many times I'm gonna start

1935
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:45,540
giving my opinion now people are not any

1937
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:48,840
times people talking my career is over

1939
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:52,770
mm-hmm no one is going to control my

1941
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:54,240
opinion and one of the things where

1943
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,210
people have been off let off the hook a

1945
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:00,150
bit was this whole oh he's crazy I look

00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:04,350
at him he's crazy that got to mute my

1949
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:07,650
opinion for 3-4 years but it's God has

1951
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:09,060
the power jesus is the force that

1953
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:13,500
brought the sanity back let me tell you

1955
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:20,400
how I brought some sad back by following

1957
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:23,780
God when you are no boo can you not be

1959
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,780
on social media literally as we speak

1961
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:33,380
just something else like this either

1963
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,970
like focus the energy here or like go

1965
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,200
somewhere else and like go just do it in

1967
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,310
another room but something but I'm not

1969
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:42,230
trying to put your butt so just saying

1971
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:44,150
that I'm like that I know but I go into

1973
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:48,440
this transcendent state in this day that

1975
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:50,990
he was come where like oh I'm actually

1977
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,970
reading Larry's mind

1979
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:55,910
what's Larry think as you're speaking

1981
00:45:52,970 --> 00:46:00,590
I'm actually reading Josh's mind I'm

1983
00:45:55,910 --> 00:46:02,930
reading mr. Boies mine but what happened

1985
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:07,220
exactly case in point something on the

1987
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:08,900
internet took oh distracted booze - what

1989
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,760
we're talking about when people pray

1991
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,620
together and you're in a room together

1993
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,140
you can think things all the way through

1995
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:18,470
when that energy builds up because

1997
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:20,600
artists are like a lake we reflect

1999
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:22,190
what's in front of us so if you're in

2001
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,350
front of an audience in the audience is

2003
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:25,970
wider you might say everybody throw your

2005
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:28,340
hands in the air yeah that wouldn't be

2007
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:29,360
appropriate if you like came in as one

2009
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:32,810
person sitting at the breakfast table

2011
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:36,470
you like everybody thought yeah I'm just

2013
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:40,250
one person what I'm saying is you're a

2015
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:42,620
reflection of in a room that you're in

2017
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:43,880
where you are yeah you're absorbing and

2019
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,960
absorbing that energy try to translate

2021
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,420
that energy and create something great

2023
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,910
yeah you know I want actually that

2025
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:53,030
brings something to mind when I saw the

2027
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:55,040
Pablo tour with the stage and I watched

2029
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:57,530
the way that people moved under it it

2031
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,600
felt like a worship and it felt the

2033
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:01,400
reaction felt like like icon an idol

2035
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:05,780
worship it didn't feel like it like a

2037
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:07,520
normal show and I wonder now that you're

2039
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,380
putting your energy into something

2041
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:14,030
channeling it into something bigger than

2043
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:16,850
you how hard that is looking back on it

2045
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:18,080
with some hindsight just reflect for a

2047
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,580
minute how hard it is being on a stage

2049
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,900
when all that energy is coming at you

2051
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:26,270
and you didn't have a place to channel

2053
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:28,130
it like faith you you exactly this exact

2055
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:32,390
point I was making when you're not

2057
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:34,940
serving God you're serving everyone else

2059
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:36,170
you're serving your ego you're serving

2061
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,590
your bank account you're serving your

2063
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,930
legs

2065
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:40,820
see you're you know serving your wife

2067
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:43,940
and kids yes is a good thing sir you're

2069
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:47,330
serving your management or the people

2071
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,740
that you're managing you're serving you

2073
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:50,510
serve a Hollywood you're serving your

2075
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,280
reputation you're serving the the

2077
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:57,860
responsibility of your race you're

2079
00:47:52,280 --> 00:48:00,470
serving you know there's a so the thing

2081
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:04,580
is I am you'd say with what I do with

2083
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:07,100
music that I am a a top chef be like of

2085
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:09,470
five stars Michelin chef correct of what

2087
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:12,950
I do with music right so imagine that

2089
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:14,840
level of chef having to serve at ten

2091
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:17,000
different restaurants all at the same

2093
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,900
time right and drive different places

2095
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,090
those meals

2097
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:22,430
sounds like a road to bankruptcy a road

2099
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:24,560
to bankruptcy a road to TMZ quotes a

2101
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:26,600
road to the world just not understand

00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,370
any holding out with your friends yeah a

2105
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,430
falling out with your friends and people

2107
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:33,890
just not understanding the main thing is

2109
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:35,390
look we are living in the dark ages

2111
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:37,250
we're living in an age where people die

2113
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:40,430
of hunger we're living in an age where

2115
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:41,990
people are being killed in the street by

2117
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:44,210
their own race we're living in an age

2119
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:45,470
where one in three african-americans are

2121
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:47,450
being locked up we're living at age

2123
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:49,310
where there are children being held at

2125
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,690
the border some with their real present

2127
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:52,460
parents some not with their real parents

2129
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,670
we were living at age where houses are

2131
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:58,220
not sustaining through hurricanes and

2133
00:48:54,670 --> 00:49:00,380
there's companies that are worth

2135
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:03,530
trillions of dollars around the world

2137
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:07,250
with geniuses just working on how to

2139
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:09,080
make solely their product better we're

2141
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:12,590
living at age where someone could be

2143
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:16,640
fired for what they think if they say it

2145
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:19,490
out loud that's the age wake up this is

2147
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,250
2019 this is where we are at right now

2149
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:27,110
this is what Dave Chappelle whole point

2151
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:29,660
was stop chilling the art the artists

2153
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:32,350
are supposed to express themselves to be

2155
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:37,370
able to have that eternal three-year-old

2157
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:40,450
at all costs people say oh this is going

2159
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:43,400
to kill your brand but my brand is

2161
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:45,940
expressing how I feel whether it's in

2163
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:49,150
line with what you thought the brand was

2165
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:50,600
even two days ago a smart man

2167
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,180
has the

2169
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:56,120
to pivot and say I think something

2171
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:58,660
different now I don't think this because

2173
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:02,210
this was the culture I don't think North

2175
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:04,250
should wear crop tops just because I had

2177
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:07,460
a way in a slip dress when she was 2

2179
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:10,730
years old I think and feel differently

2181
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:12,140
now now that I am Christian now that I'm

2183
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:15,170
the founder of a 3 billion dollar

2185
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:18,410
organization and married for five years

2187
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:22,070
I have five years of marriage under my

2189
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:23,720
belt now tell me who you gonna listen to

2191
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:25,840
what have you learned from five years of

2193
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:28,430
marriage what do you learn from that

2195
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:34,970
what I learned from five years of

2197
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:40,630
marriage is it is the greatest bond it

2199
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:44,420
is a god bond to be able to have someone

2201
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:47,030
that you can call along someone you

2203
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:50,800
could call out someone that could call

2205
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:56,240
on you and call you out equally yoked

2207
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:59,330
someone to complain to and someone to

2209
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,580
grow with as we grow and raise our

2211
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:03,040
children that sounds like real

2213
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:05,030
commitment like I'm not just saying like

2215
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,810
ten years of marriage but that sounds

2217
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:12,490
like a life long realization those are

2219
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:15,170
all key attributes to a lifelong bond

2221
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:17,330
absolutely that's it I mean I told my

2223
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:19,700
wife I said Jesus King is coming there's

2225
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:22,100
gonna be a lot of attacks there's gonna

2227
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:23,620
be some silly attacks what do you say

2229
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:26,540
that are you talking about spiritual

2231
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:29,960
spiritual attacks just spiritual warfare

2233
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:32,030
and then also just societal control

2235
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,580
attacks and I was afraid to speak my

2237
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:37,010
mind when I was when I didn't know my

2239
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,360
Master's all my Master's you think I

2241
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,850
ain't gonna talk my mind right now

2243
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,350
uh-huh

2245
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:48,520
you know saying this give me some other

2247
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:48,520
examples where someone is saying

2249
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:56,030
something that isn't what you're

2251
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:59,630
culturally supposed to say hmm give me

2253
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:01,640
an example of something of a position

2255
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:04,310
where someone is saying something that

2257
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:06,770
you're not culturally supposed to say we

2259
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:10,610
there I bet it's only one name you could

2261
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:15,020
think of you don't want to say it did

2263
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:20,510
you live by the way I'm alright with

2265
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:23,600
that say that name Donald Trump's on the

2267
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:26,120
list no doubt about it and I and I don't

2269
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,350
I'm not a fan man oh and that's that

2271
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,700
that's an understatement right but

2273
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,810
that's okay we're different we and we

2275
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,340
have different approaches now we live

2277
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,720
our life but one thing you said earlier

2279
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,830
on which I do totally relate to which I

2281
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,850
love is we're trying to leave the world

2283
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:38,420
a better place for the people who have

2285
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:40,790
mattered to us how kids okay and if

2287
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,720
you're too young to have kids you're

2289
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:45,170
trying to make the world a better place

2291
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:47,030
for yourself and she may be in a

2293
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:50,060
situation where it's expected of her now

2295
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:51,800
but I do think Greta Thun Berg at one

2297
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:56,240
point was on their list having a 16 year

2299
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:57,380
old kid from Sweden coming out and

2301
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,760
putting everything on hold and saying

2303
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,500
what she believed in and climate change

2305
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,600
does consume me and I do think it's an

2307
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,030
issue and I think the fact that she came

2309
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,170
out did that was huge and now it's like

2311
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:07,430
oh that's culturally accepted cuz she

2313
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:09,800
has an army of kids behind it but at the

2315
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,060
time she was one kid she's the only

2317
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,300
person who stood out in the street and

2319
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:15,530
did that mmm on her own do you how many

2321
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,240
times I've walked down the street when

2323
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:18,650
I'd been so frustrated about that and

2325
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,120
thought what if I just stop what I'm

2327
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:21,920
doing is stand out in the middle of a

2329
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,630
street in Los Angeles with the placard

2331
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,160
would anyone join me right I'm sure I'm

2333
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:27,830
not alone of feeling that way and if it

2335
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,720
was overwhelming like what changes are

2337
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:33,650
really gonna make she just showed us up

2339
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:36,800
she did that on her own started with one

2341
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:42,290
person no I was beautiful and it's

2343
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:45,020
beautiful but it's also terrifying that

2345
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:47,240
we're leaving that world you know I see

2347
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,770
why you're here I get it I understand

2349
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,410
why you why you're checking out it was

2351
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:53,840
too noisy for you there it was too noisy

2353
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:56,810
and he responded by making as much noise

2355
00:53:53,840 --> 00:54:00,320
as you could and we're lucky we got

2357
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:03,500
amazing art out of it amazing art if

2359
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:05,510
this was a trade Kanye we did all right

2361
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,730
out of it you know what there's a funny

2363
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:10,130
facts well that's good but also I own

2365
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:13,700
nobody nothing my forefathers have

2367
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:16,430
already fought the fight so it's not a

2369
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,840
fight when I put the Hat on it's simply

2371
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:20,260
my opinion

2373
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,650
it's next subject fair enough fair

2375
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:24,170
enough

2377
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:27,440
you know there is part of you that is

2379
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:29,750
liberal I'm the most liberal

2381
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,490
you forgot your liberals the Liberals

2383
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:33,020

00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:34,580
down the mountain here in Wyoming like

2387
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,770
on horses and stuff it's like you know

2389
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:39,290
come on but it wouldn't come to my home

2391
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:41,780
and they'd rather be with no self

2393
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:43,610
service and you know and the valley just

2395
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:45,260

2441
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:46,970
got a sense of humor thing why Lucas

2443
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:49,100
he's the polar opposite of way of where

2445
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:50,660
you're at no no it's just because there

2447
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:56,000
was a rivalry oh right right right right

2449
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:59,140
now liberals love art right and now I am

2451
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,420
unquestionably undoubtedly the greatest

2453
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:03,590
human artists of all time it's just not

2455
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:07,070
even a question anymore at this point

2457
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:14,200
it's just a fact right so for the

2459
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:14,200
greatest artists in human existence to

2461
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:22,120
put a red hat on was like God practical

2463
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:22,120
joke right

2465
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:30,440
it hurts so much it hurts so many it

2467
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:32,720
hurt people a lot you know because you

2469
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:35,300
are held up as this person who continues

2471
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,609
to provide us but though but those

2473
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:40,819
little those liberals never know fans

2475
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:44,810
man fans fan or also fans fans and

2477
00:56:40,819 --> 00:56:46,940
liberals never stood in front of the

2479
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:49,160
prison's to stop their from being one

2481
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:51,920
and three locked up or the system that

2483
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:56,210
set up with is actually not enough legal

2485
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:58,520
job opportunities yeah for us to avoid

2487
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:00,260
from being locked up now you got the

2489
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:03,790
Clintons that's privately-owned prisons

2491
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:07,900
you got I'm saying it's like everyone

2493
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:12,230
everyone no one is God

2495
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:17,150
everyone bases their opinions on a group

2497
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:19,910
of propaganda esque images fed to us

2499
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:21,950
from the very first cartoon or the very

2501
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:24,760
first cereal box that we saw in a

2503
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:30,710
grocery store and our environment

2505
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:34,310
friends schools religion country music

2507
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:37,670
rebel Institute all informs our opinion

2509
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:44,230
and what side were all we've been herded

2511
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:49,010
into an idea of blue or red right left

2513
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:51,440
but there's actually a time when we were

2515
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:53,300
closer to heaven when we were six months

2517
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,680
before we could learn before we learn

2519
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:57,319
how to be before things got so

2521
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,510
complement so so complicated what we

2523
00:57:57,319 --> 00:58:01,880
actually had more in common all of these

2525
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:04,190
things that separate us it's like when

2527
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:06,470
you don't spend time talking to somebody

2529
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:07,760
for a long time you start to build up

2531
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:10,250
more and more and more and more and more

2533
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,050
reasons yeah you should be this anxiety

2535
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:14,260
in it and that distance creates that

2537
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:17,839
anxiety this distance is created anxiety

2539
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:20,180
we we are the same human beings we are

2541
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:24,079
God's and that man versus machine is man

2543
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:26,180
is the machine so if you wants imperfect

2545
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,680
creation because we perish go ahead so

2547
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:30,800
if you're in a situation now where

2549
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,880
you're able to do you want to mend that

2551
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,770
you want to bring those things together

2553
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,450
starting with the relationships in your

2555
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:37,099
life are you able to do that with the

2557
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:38,350
with the friendships that have been a

2559
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:39,640
bit of deviate you talk about

2561
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:41,980
the rivalry would drag you talk about

2563
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,540
this public fallout with people who

2565
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,100
you've shared a really valuable part of

2567
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:46,840
your life with jay-z people like that

2569
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,670
are you able to men that is this putting

2571
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,020
you on a path of recovery and personal

2573
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:51,790
relationships as much as it isn't your

2575
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:55,870
own relationship absolutely

2577
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:56,950
you cannot be in service to God and be

2579
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,450
mad at your brother

2581
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,180

love all of these people but you got to

2629
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:21,610
know there's a there's a lineage of JT a

2631
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:25,180
to Drake it's you know this person is

2633
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:27,040
your idol then you get to know him then

2635
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,820
you be friends then you turn to

2637
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:32,140
frenemies

2639
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:33,220
then you turn the enemies and then you

2641
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,290
gotta bring back the positive energy

2643
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:36,790
mm-hmm

2645
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:40,750
but that is the lineage of like rap

2647
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:46,299
Kings you know and inspire us cuz J was

2649
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:48,849
my biggest you know it's right

2651
01:00:46,299 --> 01:00:52,469
time I got to New York we had to throw

2653
01:00:48,849 --> 01:00:56,949
backs I'm gonna tell you I'm really a

2655
01:00:52,469 --> 01:00:59,229
big boy had to throw backs first and the

2657
01:00:56,949 --> 01:01:00,939
what was it it's called sky high I think

2659
01:00:59,229 --> 01:01:02,410
he had the Astros and then he had

2661
01:01:00,939 --> 01:01:06,549
another one I think you might have had

2663
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:08,019
in the watch for the hook video

2665
01:01:06,549 --> 01:01:11,349
he might add it but Mitchell has had a

2667
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:12,549
little stand and Lennox and I would be

2669
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:14,499
going down there doing beats for

2671
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:17,289
Jermaine Dupri now pull it up to the

2673
01:01:14,499 --> 01:01:19,299
stand and try to throw back we started

2675
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:24,279
getting a lot of throw backs and I pull

2677
01:01:19,299 --> 01:01:26,920
up to you know baselines and they were

2679
01:01:24,279 --> 01:01:29,319
like you know I pull up with my throw

2681
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,640
back and like Jays like man that's nice

2683
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:32,289
not like that

2685
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,839
then I pull up the next I got another

2687
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:43,359
throw back there for days they said what

2689
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:45,849
you're staying Ilana and then Darcy was

2691
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:48,299
using this thing that we that we hadn't

2693
01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:52,059
heard of called the internet selling

2695
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:54,369

had a store like RSVP it's crazy that

2699
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:58,269
was like it think about think about that

2701
01:01:56,619 --> 01:01:59,259
for a second think about like that

2703
01:01:58,269 --> 01:02:01,569
probably feels like a drop in the ocean

2705
01:01:59,259 --> 01:02:03,910
right yeah how innocent that time was

2707
01:02:01,569 --> 01:02:05,079
back then yeah who you were back then

2709
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:06,849
versus who you are now

2711
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:10,809
hmm and the journey you've been on to

2713
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:13,479

01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:16,119

removing Jesus's wife from

2745
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:06,610
the eye

2747
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:09,460
that's a huh I went to the Vatican and

2749
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:12,190
it was a Raphael painting and the person

2751
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:15,370
said this blacked out part is where

2753
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:17,080
Raphael painted Jesus wife and the Pope

2755
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:19,270
was so mad that he sent people to kill

2757
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,950
him in Raphael died of a cold before

2759
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:22,960
they could kill her mm-hmm and that was

2761
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:24,640
when I was saying about when they wanted

2763
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:27,640
to tear the domes down I was like I was

2765
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:30,160
gonna tear it down before y'all hmm like

2767
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,450
there's no win in that but I was gonna

2769
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:35,260
tear down cuz I was just experimenting

2771
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:36,790
anyway they think they you know I'm

2773
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:39,100
saying he did something they think la oh

2775
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:40,150
man we made you tell ya I was experiment

2777
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:42,040
with them domes anyway

2779
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:44,290
yeah we just trying to get we're just

2781
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,670
getting proportions we're seeing what it

2783
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:48,580
felt like we took the domes up and we

2785
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:51,010
may eat there and we started having you

2787
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:52,660
know things like you want some 3,000

2789
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:56,040
years old era you'd say I was 3,000

2791
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:58,420
years ago we stepped into how

2793
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:00,340
proprietary can you be in an environment

2795
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,900
where you serve the Lord and I want to

2797
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:03,820
bring up a specific example this this

2799
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:06,610
idea of that is such a good question

2801
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:08,170
this idea of trademarking Sunday service

2803
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:09,850
which ultimately is a terming have

2805
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:11,140
created an environment which is communal

2807
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:13,240
and belongs to everyone isn't just a

2809
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:15,370
Kanye West Show but there's the idea of

2811
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:17,890
like ownership over that term how does

2813
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:21,400
proprietary behavior exist in a time of

2815
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:24,670
ultimate servitude it isn't everything

2817
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:28,900
is for a god and we can receive

2819
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:30,700
donations mmm that's the only way that

2821
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:34,000
it can work so that's so the money you

2823
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:39,070
make from the merch is is in donation to

2825
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:44,260
the cause I mean I would say some you

2827
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:46,210
know spent if if tithing is 20 if

2829
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:48,880
tithing is 10 percent Sunday services

2831
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:51,910
devta called me 20 percent at this time

2833
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:56,470
but that mean sure let me just uh so let

2835
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:59,470
me let me make sure but it's the

2837
01:04:56,470 --> 01:05:02,830
iteration where we haven't completely

2839
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:07,930
solved it so we're praying on it we're

2841
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:13,420
praying for the answer mmm in God's time

2843
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:14,130
for me to be able to work only for the

2845
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:16,930
church

2847
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:19,930
that you wanna save my 20-year vision

2851
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:26,710
I do is for the church even designing a

01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,640
everything is for the church that's a

2861
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:42,790
vision that I that I have to be able to

2863
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:45,760
be an innovator and Christian innovator

2865
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:48,100
Christian innovator think about this you

2867
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,200
know it's a lotta a lot of organizations

2869
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:52,510
have capitalized on my creativity and

2871
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:55,630
innovation so if everything is for the

2873
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:58,480
church and that includes the edit the

2875
01:05:55,630 --> 01:06:01,090
relationship with your fans let me ask

2877
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:04,510
you this what is the relationship

2879
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:08,350
between a Kanye West fan and somebody

2881
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:12,400
who ultimately is following the same

2883
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:14,290
path as you and is there a desire is

2885
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:17,980
there a desire ultimately to convert--

2887
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:19,840
to convert-- to convert-- people through

2889
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:22,000
this process it's not a desire it's my

2891
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:24,390
only mission and calling is to spread

2893
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,390
the gospel

2895
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:37,300
when I make a song is to spread the

2897
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:40,730
gospel when we make a device this

2899
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:44,770
portable stem player that we design with

2901
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:47,660
teenage engineering for this album and

2903
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:52,070
albums move forward is to spread the

2905
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:56,060
gospel this the ranch any wrench that we

2907
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:59,810
use the ideas of behind it to shred the

2909
01:06:56,060 --> 01:07:02,510
gospel to show everything that I do and

2911
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:04,670
to be more respectful to my body as a

2913
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:06,800
temple yeah you know even like you know

2915
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:09,200
I had I was thinking all you know just

2917
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,490
using my mind and running this company

2919
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:13,490
was good enough no I need to

2921
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:16,460
hmm you know watch my diet a happy

2923
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:18,740
ending what changes anything

2925
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:22,150
I didn't order that frozen margarita

2927
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:24,650
today at UH at lunch do you drink it all

2929
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:30,290
you know what I had stopped drinking

2931
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:33,230
completely when when I first converted

2933
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:36,170
and now I'll have a drink it's just

2935
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:38,420
mm-hmm what I what I've been told is to

2937
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:41,839
not have drunkenness something because I

2939
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:45,560
was thinking man it's just the taste of

2941
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:47,089
alcohol a sin to taste the alcohol on

2943
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,530
your lips just I'm trying to work out

2945
01:07:47,089 --> 01:07:51,710
like like when you've come for okay so

2947
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:53,089
check it out so if this if if becoming a

2949
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:55,750
born-again Christian is an ultimate

2951
01:07:53,089 --> 01:07:59,330
reflection upon life before as being sin

2953
01:07:55,750 --> 01:08:01,940
right not everything in life was sin but

2955
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:03,920
when you first become born-again that's

2957
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:06,290
what you have to address you have to

2959
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,359
take a look at the whole picture and and

2961
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:11,060
almost untangle it from that work

2963
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:13,460
backwards from that right like what is a

2965
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:14,660
sin and what is not that's a that's an

2967
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:18,020
intense experience

2969
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:20,750
we're only yes and then you figure out

2971
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:23,989
that you still sin I started giving

2973
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:26,870
myself to curses a day Oh like there's a

2975
01:08:23,989 --> 01:08:28,100
video game like wow oh this is now

2977
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,569
people say you know God doesn't have a

2979
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:32,089
scorecard I gave myself a Christian

2981
01:08:29,569 --> 01:08:35,120
scorecard yeah and I'd like today yeah I

2983
01:08:32,089 --> 01:08:37,670
was like I hit an 80 yeah oh yeah 90 I

2985
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,020
hit a 90 and at certain times I get on

2987
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:41,329
the phone with somebody about Manny

2989
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:43,190
about the lower my Christian scorecard

2991
01:08:41,329 --> 01:08:44,089
like it already because you're trying it

2993
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:46,639
because you're trying to be the best

2995
01:08:44,089 --> 01:08:48,980
Christian you can be from day one you

2997
01:08:46,639 --> 01:08:50,569
always want to be but I mean like you

2999
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:52,099
know what I'm having I'm trying to wake

3001
01:08:50,569 --> 01:08:53,420
this technology out myself but you've

3003
01:08:52,099 --> 01:08:55,460
always been a Christian but you've made

3005
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:57,559
a complete complete commitment so it's

3007
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:59,599
all or nothing from day one and then you

3009
01:08:57,559 --> 01:09:01,909
have to work in what is appropriate from

3011
01:08:59,599 --> 01:09:07,520
that point forward but it's it's never

3013
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:09,440
all or nothing because you you're a

3015
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,239
human being right right right yes I

3017
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,529
guess I'm getting a are you allowing use

3019
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:14,150
are you being kind to yourself through

3021
01:09:12,529 --> 01:09:18,109
this process are you allowing fell

3023
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:21,290
ability in this process yeah but then I

3025
01:09:18,109 --> 01:09:25,130
be repenting because I'll you know going

3027
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:27,650
like look at some I'm a supposed to be

3029
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:29,989
looking out on the internet right and

3031
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:32,540
how do you process that now guilt and

3033
01:09:29,989 --> 01:09:33,619
then this route is I'm not saying oh no

3035
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,940
no no shame

3037
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:40,069
now that's something that Christ has

3039
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:43,040
removed is the shame what happened is

3041
01:09:40,069 --> 01:09:44,929
it's it doesn't work like Karma God is

3043
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,460
so merciful that it's not directly

3045
01:09:44,929 --> 01:09:48,170
connected so this is a thought in my

3047
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:50,599
mind it's incorrect and quite arrogant

3049
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:55,550
to think that God would immediately

3051
01:09:50,599 --> 01:09:58,070
punish me for me knowingly falling short

3053
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:59,420
the ego talking again yes the ego

3055
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:02,090
talking but I give you I just give you

3057
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:04,070
an example of it you know see if I slip

3059
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:07,849
up and look at something pornographic

3061
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:11,690
online and then the next day I get into

3063
01:10:07,849 --> 01:10:13,670
a big argument with my wife or or some

3065
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:17,780
of the designs don't come back right at

3067
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:19,010
the office or a song we lose a foul or

3069
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:23,260
something someone else show up to the

3071
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:26,420
studio you know this is incorrect but

3073
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:28,130
this ego and arrogance has me thinking

3075
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:30,260
oh it's because I did that thing right

3077
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:32,329
and then I installation yeah I try to

3079
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:34,159
correlate it but that's not God God

3081
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:36,139
doesn't work like that and we we don't

3083
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:39,940
know how God works but I'll go and be

3085
01:10:36,139 --> 01:10:42,940
repeated I'm sorry for those nuts that

3087
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:42,940
interracial

3089
01:10:44,739 --> 01:10:50,280
I thought is the most like me about why

3091
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:53,890
you've got fences here but how far do

3093
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:59,080
you walk how far you let yourself go

3095
01:10:53,890 --> 01:11:01,000
into this artists do like a 30 40 minute

3097
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:03,400
walk you could go for days bro

3099
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,930
don't ever get tempted to do that don't

3101
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:08,020
you ever get tempted to just like if you

3103
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:09,610
want to go back like just see what it

3105
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:10,420
would be like to just walk it walk off

3107
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:14,110
into the distance

3109
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:15,310
you own it all yes it's just for hours

3111
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:16,810
now used to get other stuff on my

3113
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:25,750
schedule but isn't that what you like to

3115
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:27,760
like these liberals we're running around

3117
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:29,890
trying to do what we can to help the

3119
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,420
world and but it got this ultimately a

3121
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:33,460
process you'd be trying to slow things

3123
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:35,380
down and find space to do that to give

3125
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:38,730
you some space to think have you been

3127
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:45,280
able to do that yes switch off like that

3129
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:47,170
yeah well you know the most space that I

3131
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:51,000
had to think is when I went to the

3133
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:54,430
hospital yeah in 2016

3135
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,410
yeah I'm not sure if the wind picked it

3137
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:57,700
up but I asked you I said to you do you

3139
01:11:56,410 --> 01:12:00,070
ever just take the time to walk your

3141
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:01,480
land and just think and surely do it to

3143
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:03,940
a some degree you bought this place and

3145
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:06,730
you you've redesigned your approach to

3147
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:07,719
living and in order to find space to

3149
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:10,390
think

3151
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:11,650
and you scuse me and you said I'm one of

3153
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:13,239
the only places that what the place we

3155
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:16,690
thought you really got to think was in

3157
01:12:13,239 --> 01:12:18,790
hospital in 2016 and I wonder that's

3159
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:20,620
where I had the most space mmm to think

3161
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:22,390
what came from that experience on you

3163
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:26,890
know in terms of the processing one of

3165
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:28,690
the things that was written we have the

3167
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:31,060
booklets that I were right one of the

3169
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:32,590
things that I wrote down was build a

3171
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:37,630
church in Calabasas

3173
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:39,730
so we were at Sunday service and we were

3175
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:40,510
doing a set adrift from memory bliss of

3177
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:43,360
you mm-hmm

3179
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:48,450
no I would die without him now I would

3181
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:51,370
I'd you and um my wife showed me where I

3183
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:54,290
have wrote sample p.m. dawn die without

3185
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:56,460
you so

3187
01:12:54,290 --> 01:13:00,750
one of the things that happened when I

3189
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:02,250
went to the hospital as I started

3191
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:05,190
reading the Bible and I started writing

3193
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:08,520
out copying and writing out Bible verses

3195
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:11,550
and a person came to my house

3197
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:14,280
that wasn't a Christian and told me come

3199
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:16,980
over and then 30 minutes later I was in

3201
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,900
handcuffs headed to the hospital now

3203
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:21,090
this person very well may have saved my

3205
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:23,490
life because when you're in an episode

3207
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:25,980
you can jump off the side of a balcony

3209
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:28,740
you can stab your high presence of mind

3211
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:33,420
is not yeah you could do a lot of things

3213
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:36,240
when you're ramped up like that but one

3215
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:42,120
of the things that people do now is they

3217
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:47,820
try to discriminate against my mind and

3219
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:50,190
my thoughts because of that moment it's

3221
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:54,060
like if someone you know went to jail

3223
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:56,400
and now they're working at an office and

3225
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:57,690
they have an argument with somebody who

3227
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:01,650
are they gonna blame for the argument

3229
01:13:57,690 --> 01:14:07,680
the guy that went to jail so I still

3231
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:12,300
have radical thoughts visions future

3233
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:15,000
ideas and sometimes when I say them out

3235
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:19,680
loud people could just denounce it and

3237
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,000
say oh you're crazy no and I think about

3239
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,860
I don't buy that because it's someone

3241
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,010
who has it suffered with mental health

3243
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:27,510
issues throughout my life hmm and you

3245
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:29,370
know had to really develop tools in

3247
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:31,620
order to do them to protect my family

3249
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:36,500
because I can definitely find myself in

3251
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:39,120
a very very dark place I'm grateful for

3253
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:40,190
those experiences in those thoughts oh

3255
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:44,550
absolutely

3257
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:46,530
to be able to have gone that far to go

3259
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:48,390
to places that people say only ayahuasca

3261
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:52,290
and different things can take you but to

3263
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:57,270
naturally be able to think that far and

3265
01:14:52,290 --> 01:15:00,150
connect and the way you know I feel

3267
01:14:57,270 --> 01:15:05,030
another thing related to me wearing the

3269
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:07,770
Hat that liberals love to do is say all

3271
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:10,320
this relates to mental health

3273
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:13,470
his story is meant to help is he like my

3275
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:17,760
wife or go places and people will be

3277
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:21,090
like it's J okay is he doing is he okay

3279
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:23,520
like Kobe Bryant has won five

3281
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:28,710
championships and he's got a lot of

3283
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:32,360
injuries is his story isn't pulling an

3285
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:37,760
Achilles and every story after that how

3287
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:40,620
he pulled an Achilles but the same press

3289
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:43,860
that doesn't want to do the press and

3291
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:48,350
doesn't want to say hey easy is the most

3293
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:52,140
Google brand and this guy is a

3295
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:54,420
billionaire this guy is a black Trump

3297
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:59,190
supporter this guy is they want to make

3299
01:15:54,420 --> 01:16:04,050
the conversation always be about mental

3301
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:07,590
health and I do love the fact that I can

3303
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:10,500
show the world that I'm sitting here and

3305
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:12,780
have been diagnosed put on medication

3307
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:14,280
medication to make me fat on purpose

3309
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:15,390
because after I didn't want to take the

3311
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,890
meds they're like okay we got this

3313
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:22,470
version I don't make you fat they're

3315
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:25,640
trying to kill the superhero so I'm here

3317
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:31,110
to show that someone that's diagnosed

3319
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:33,240
can still drive and be the founder of a

3321
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:36,630
multi-billion dollar organization can

3323
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:39,570
still be in service to Christ can still

3325
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:43,440
be a good husband and a good dad my life

3327
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:45,720
does not end with this diagnosis no and

3329
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,520
I will not be stigmatized I'm gonna say

3331
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,200
one thing and discriminated no I'm sorry

3333
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,550
I'm say wonder from my perspective I've

3335
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,140
said this in public too actually isn't

3337
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:53,880
private too many my friends you know

3339
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:57,480
when I heard the kids he goes project in

3341
01:16:53,880 --> 01:17:00,000
particular that project was one of the

3343
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:02,160
first things that I'd heard that not

3345
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,410
only remove the stigma of having mental

3347
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:07,820
health issues but like you said put a

3349
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:10,290
cape on it mmm-hmm gave it a power I

3351
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:15,210
think we're the mint where people get

3353
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:17,190
confused and align it with mental

3355
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:19,349
instability as is if I may say as the

3357
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:23,219
distribution of the information

3359
01:17:19,349 --> 01:17:24,900
oh you may like when I tweet a hundred

3361
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:28,739
tweets or when you go off and you do it

3363
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:30,060
all in two weeks and everyone sees this

3365
01:17:28,739 --> 01:17:31,739
flurry of activity and it's like

3367
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:33,210
everyday there's three things coming at

3369
01:17:31,739 --> 01:17:35,820
you that you're distributing information

3371
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:37,440
wise then people I think their natural

3373
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:39,480
instincts if I can speak for people are

3375
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:41,460
to go is he okay

3377
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:43,889
there seems to be a lot of disruption

3379
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:45,869
and instability going on around him in

3381
01:17:43,889 --> 01:17:48,449
this very short window of time does that

3383
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:52,800
make sense yeah but I've never been just

3385
01:17:48,449 --> 01:17:56,190
okay I've always been amazing so they

3387
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:58,980
want me to operate in a just-okay format

3389
01:17:56,190 --> 01:18:01,230
mmm and that's not the format that I'm

3391
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:04,020
in it and I mean the biggest it's always

3393
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:09,239
the defense you just said it's okay but

3395
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:11,219
it's not okay it's amazing HSP highly

3397
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:13,530
sensitive people meaning people who

3399
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:15,060
can't stand the BS I can't sit with

3401
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:18,030
something on my spirit for more than a

3403
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:19,710
day I can't go to sleep on it I got I

3405
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:23,219
have to express it

3407
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:25,170
the what when I was you know me and

3409
01:18:23,219 --> 01:18:28,530
Drake had a disagreement and he refused

3411
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:32,550
to talk to me for six months that was so

3413
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:35,699
painful because expressing yourself as a

3415
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:39,020
form of therapy for people with mental

3417
01:18:35,699 --> 01:18:41,520
health so you saw I expressed myself

3419
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:43,650
I've been waiting to express myself for

3421
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:47,010
a long time and then the expression

3423
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:50,670
fully came out people that are locked up

3425
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:52,829
a lot of times ran out of words the

3427
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:56,909
expression went to I'm just about to go

3429
01:18:52,829 --> 01:18:58,590
shoot somebody or I'm I'm going crazy

3431
01:18:56,909 --> 01:19:03,199
because I don't have a way to feed my

3433
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:06,510
family or my gang said that I'm

3435
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:08,730
disrespected and if I don't go and kill

3437
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:11,400
this person then they gonna look at me

3439
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:13,650
like I'm not strong so it's a lot of

3441
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,480
things with people are driven to not

3443
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:16,679
have a conversation all the way through

3445
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:18,780
another thing I was thinking about when

3447
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:20,520
I use the bathroom over the day well I

3449
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:21,630
take it early just now although I was

3451
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:25,960
taking a piss because it pissed me off

3453
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:31,409
is when the media says

3455
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:34,719
Kanye defends his support of Trump I

3457
01:19:31,409 --> 01:19:36,550
didn't know I was in a courtroom I got

3459
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:39,489
to defend nothing it's not a defense

3461
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:41,320
you know if every time someone asks you

3463
01:19:39,489 --> 01:19:43,650
a question you try to say the right

3465
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:46,030
answer your entire life is a test and

3467
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:47,560
when did you have the most anxiety in

3469
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:50,170
grammar school of high school no request

3471
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:52,659
on test day so your entire life become

3473
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:55,179
this test I ain't trying to say the

3475
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:58,360
right answer I am just doing what I feel

3477
01:19:55,179 --> 01:20:03,010
my mama said trying is failing there is

3479
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:08,050
no ifs Woods could shut it just is and

3481
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:11,890
we just are and it is so it's simple

3483
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:15,909
that's like and this mentality should

3485
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:20,350
not be defeated yay cannot die yay

3487
01:20:15,909 --> 01:20:23,020
cannot be buried there is nothing there

3489
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:26,620
a matter of fact no enemy there is I my

3491
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:28,360
only only the enemy is a concept this

3493
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:30,000
out it's like a game

3495
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:33,010
think about it you play a video game

3497
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:36,130
there's an antagonist but it wouldn't be

3499
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:37,630
a game unless there was opposition I

3501
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:41,980
ain't trying to play ping pong by myself

3503
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:44,880
hmm so they set up new goals where

3505
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:52,150
there's one time we was like okay

3507
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:53,409
Drake is your rival now I think I think

3509
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:57,280
more about Bernard Arnault than I think

3511
01:20:53,409 --> 01:21:00,100
about Drake because he might have

3513
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:02,590
thought he got culture by taking Virgil

3515
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:05,890
but it's like no now you're having a

3517
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:12,190
pilfer from my territory you came in and

3519
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:17,140
took one person that is african-american

3521
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:19,270
is African and that could be the face to

3523
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:22,179
draw Louis Vuitton on the side of backs

3525
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:24,610
and get people that look at Instagram

3527
01:21:22,179 --> 01:21:28,300
and want to buy expensive items that are

3529
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:32,140
of the culture so to say to over spin on

3531
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:34,330
things all no actually stepped into my

3533
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:36,370
territory how'd that make you feel

3535
01:21:34,330 --> 01:21:37,929
initially when that happen at the

3537
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:38,739
beginning not when you hugged each other

3539
01:21:37,929 --> 01:21:40,930
at

3541
01:21:38,739 --> 01:21:43,030
you know at the Fashion Show which was

3543
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:46,210
one of the best things ever that year

3545
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:54,760
that moment at the moment when he left

3547
01:21:46,210 --> 01:22:01,930
and that happened how did you feel you

3549
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:03,070
know I felt bad I felt like it was

3551
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:04,780
supposed to be me

3553
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:07,540
I was the Louis Vuitton da people still

3555
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:11,080
call me the Louis Vuitton Don when I'm

3557
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:13,930
walking down the street but I took a

3559
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:17,320
branding from something that someone

3561
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:21,280
else had made up and is in control of it

3563
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:26,530
was completely up to Bernard who he

3565
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:32,080
wanted to dawn as the Louis Vuitton Don

3567
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:34,840
because he bought the bag brand he went

3569
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:37,540
in hired Marc Jacobs he created the

3571
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:39,760
industry he innovated the industry of

3573
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:42,070
luxury brought people out to fashion

3575
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,900
shows and pair of Paris I mean Bernardo

3577
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:47,230
is one of my heroes he's probably my top

3579
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:52,270
my dad is my top living hero and then

3581
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:54,730
like way way under that is but not

3583
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:57,850
enough because he's got the taste

3585
01:22:54,730 --> 01:23:02,920
he's got the Sensibility he's got the

3587
01:22:57,850 --> 01:23:05,770
high Manus man created the idea of even

3589
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:08,800
wanting Louis Vuitton it was just an old

3591
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:11,770
bag brand and he bought it and then he

3593
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:15,670
had the wherewithal to get this kid out

3595
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:17,940
of New York Marc Jacobs to go in and

3597
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:22,150
wrap it and bring it to the streets with

3599
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:24,280
Sprouse me and Pharrell and let him go

3601
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:29,400
Wow you know let Kim Jones do the

3603
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:37,639
supreme and now hire Virgil like I

3605
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:42,119
really admire what Bernard has done

3607
01:23:37,639 --> 01:23:45,659
he also offered me a deal five years ago

3609
01:23:42,119 --> 01:23:48,030
when we had our first gz show shook my

3611
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:49,170
hand said we never go back on a

3613
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:51,420
handshake

3615
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:54,150
then drop the deal three months later

3617
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:58,679
and it had effect on me going to the

3619
01:23:54,150 --> 01:24:00,449
hospital mmm-hmm because my first adidas

3621
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:02,639
collection that has like these pants

3623
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:04,920
from season one had line ups the second

3625
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:09,000
collection never came out because I had

3627
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:12,960
to dignify the apparel with adidas so no

3629
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:15,780
adidas no Louie Vuitton mm-hmm and for

3631
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,820

3633
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:19,139

3637
01:24:19,139 --> 01:24:25,949
no one wants to help me out I'm tweeting

3639
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:27,510
by season 3 season 4 the show was 45

3641
01:24:25,949 --> 01:24:29,280
minutes late and they LeBron to me

3643
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:30,690
meaning like they did what they did to

3645
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:39,480
LeBron when he said he's going to the

3647
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:43,170
heat my wife got robbed in Paris and our

3649
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:45,480
control yeah next thing you know I'm in

3651
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:47,460
the hospital and I have to wear that for

3653
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,809
the rest of my life but to take a bat as

3655
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:51,329
a badge of honor because it's a don't

3657
01:24:48,809 --> 01:24:55,429
treat me like a celebrity always know

3659
01:24:51,329 --> 01:24:58,530
your human being first yes one one 100%

3661
01:24:55,429 --> 01:25:00,480
and then out of anybody that they could

3663
01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:02,489
have chose no one they did that they got

3665
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:07,650
one of the best men from our wedding

3667
01:25:02,489 --> 01:25:12,630
mm-hmm and what I love about when I

3669
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:15,750
hugged Virgil is he he showed me that

3671
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:21,599
actually we're all playing on the same

3673
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:26,429
court and he went and ran that field

3675
01:25:21,599 --> 01:25:28,260
goal he ran that touchdown in for us all

3677
01:25:26,429 --> 01:25:30,599
because there was a time when we all

3679
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:33,989
were crazy there's a time when it was

3681
01:25:30,599 --> 01:25:36,960
fish sticks and South Park now everybody

3683
01:25:33,989 --> 01:25:40,920
want to pull up at a fashion show but he

3685
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:44,969
really stamped it by being that designer

3687
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:46,320
he validated it he validated and when I

3689
01:25:44,969 --> 01:25:47,750
said earlier I always thought it was

3691
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:51,230
supposed to be me

3693
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:53,239
it always was and is supposed to be me

3695
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:57,230
but I'm not supposed to be working for

3697
01:25:53,239 --> 01:26:01,840

01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:56,630
much the Instagram the Jesus Instagram

3733
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:58,400

little teddy bear there's an Instagram

3737
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,030
where a little kid is holding on to a

3739
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:04,880
little teddy bear and Jesus has this

3741
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:06,650
huge teddy bear behind his back but you

3743
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,030

3745
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:09,650
teddy bear that you've known your whole

3747
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:11,480
life that's what I was talking about to

3749
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:13,219
tradition you don't want to let go of

3751
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:17,090

there's God's got a bigger plan for you

3755
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:21,500
that's why I didn't want to even be you

3757
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:23,180
know presumptuous and arrogant like

3759
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,920
borderline blasphemous to try to tell

3761
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:28,760
you where this would be in 20 years

3763
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:31,940

01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,000
fight going on between right now there

3897
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:25,540
was not a lot of communication between

3899
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,890
side left and side up right mm-hmm I'm

3901
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:29,110
saying there's a fight going on and

3903
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:31,570
that's why you found yourself in the

3905
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:33,760
middle of that is because there's a lot

3907
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:36,850
of people on this on the left side who

3909
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:39,010
you call liberals who you have inspire

3911
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:40,480
and you give you've given us greatness

3913
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:43,540
and I know that that's not why you do it

3915
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:46,900
and I know it I am a liberal I'm a 200%

3917
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:48,550
ER mm every situation I understand my

3919
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:51,070
wife does something that makes me mad

3921
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:53,200
I'm like I understand your perspective

3923
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:58,420
of why you did right but it still makes

3925
01:30:53,200 --> 01:31:01,990
me mad right i 100% feel and understand

3927
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:06,160
why people have their position that are

3929
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:10,770
on the left i 100% understand the people

3931
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:13,540
on the right and the issue is

3933
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:17,550
communication that people are not

3935
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:21,010
communicating and for people to mute

3937
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:23,170
themselves is what I thought was the the

3939
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:26,590
harshest thing to say if you're black

3941
01:31:23,170 --> 01:31:30,550
don't talk to this person I'm gonna talk

3943
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:32,920
to everybody as long as I get air in my

3945
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:35,260
lungs like I would go pull up saved

3947
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:38,440
- hey Putin how you doing hey Kim Jong

talk I will have a conversation with

3953
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:51,370
anyone with respect and love I have

3955
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:54,640
loved it respect for everyone I don't

3957
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:55,540
have admiration for everyone but I have

3959
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:59,920
love and respect

3961
01:31:55,540 --> 01:32:03,070
mmm-hmm Jesus is king Joanna tell people

3963
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:06,340
what's coming in dissembler oh yes

3965
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:10,240
Sunday service album Jesus is born on

3967
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:12,790
Christmas mm-hmm it's coming you will

3969
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:14,920
continue to build from here outward and

3971
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:16,420
I know you only think six months in

3973
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:18,670
advance well that's what you said before

3975
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:20,380
I don't buy that part actually I know

3977
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:22,330
there's maybe an aim of yours but I do

3979
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:24,850
think that you probably have a broader

3981
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:27,490
idea about what this becomes and

3983
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:29,020
where would you like to see this when

3985
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:34,200
you finally find a place for your we're

3987
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:40,000
at peace I just will keep getting used

3989
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:43,810
by God I don't love suffering no one

3991
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:46,300
loves pain but I'm still through the

3993
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:50,860
good times and through the suffering I

3995
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:53,680
praise God because I experienced the

3997
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:57,840
blessings and also experienced the

3999
01:32:53,680 --> 01:33:00,250
lessons I'm just so blessed for

4001
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:05,980
everything I've been through to still be

4003
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:09,510
standing here and 15 years in be making

4005
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:15,340
an album with the work the paintings

4007
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:17,410
still are inspiring to me I want to hear

4009
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:21,340
them I want to listen to this I want to

4011
01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:24,700
have you know music is my job that's why

4013
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:28,330
I'm putting out the album serving God

4015
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:30,130
and everything that I can do is my job

4017
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:33,100
that's why I'm here that's why I'm on

4019
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:37,530
the planet is to be in service in fear

4021
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:42,010
love and service to God

4023
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:44,110
barri was you know throughout the summer

4025
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:47,290
he had come by and played me a new album

4027
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:51,100
with playing the Solange album then you

4029
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:52,900
know just playing new artists and we'd

4031
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:55,620
be working on clothes and he's like okay

4033
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:57,670

be gay music is your job

4039
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:08,620
it should job this is what like I

4041
01:34:04,230 --> 01:34:11,530
believe if I stopped doing music not

4043
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:15,970
because it promotes the brand I believe

4045
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:19,630
because God has given me a gift that I

4047
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:22,060
pray for and so many people love that if

4049
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:25,600
I stop doing it he might start to take

4051
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:27,910
other things away cuz Who am I to say oh

4053
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:31,210
I got these shoes now or oh we're

4055
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:35,170
building these hotels now or oh yeah you

4057
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:38,150
know I got a family now so I'm not gonna

4059
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:41,840
do music I'm not gonna give people he's

4061
01:34:38,150 --> 01:34:44,930
new ideas that I have I had to really

4063
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:47,510
and you know it's fun it's a good job

4065
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:51,500
it's a fun thing to do and I quite enjoy

4067
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:54,080
is it as fun doing it now as it was

4069
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:55,820
doing it in Hawaii or doing it in Paris

4071
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:59,690
or doing it at the Mercer or doing it

4073
01:34:55,820 --> 01:35:01,010
with J or doing it for J that's a good

4075
01:34:59,690 --> 01:35:02,660
question well I'll tell you one thing I

4077
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:06,050
quite enjoy the sound of my own voice

4079
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:08,780
and apparently by the streams billions

4081
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:10,370
of other people do also but that's not

4083
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:17,780
what else is it as I just want to do

4085
01:35:10,370 --> 01:35:21,940
that sound bite but go ahead now is it

4087
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:25,130
is fun or is it just different the job

4089
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:26,180
you know when you were wearing the

4091
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:27,770
backpack when you're sitting there

4093
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:29,480
making it or the footage of you in the

4095
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:30,920
studio just make you just literally

4097
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:32,330
vomiting up these beats like just it's

4099
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:34,400
spontaneously creating things like no

4101
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:35,510
one else can on this keyboard and making

4103
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:41,090
these bangers and coming up with this

4105
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:42,650
stuff is it is it as fun I mean we sit

4107
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:44,420
in here in front of ten chirps do did a

4109
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:46,370
little fun to you we could drive on the

4111
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:48,680
lake we got a lake look it's making

4113
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:50,840
music this fun is your job is what I'm

4115
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:53,000
saying this is a part of my job this is

4117
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:57,410
what I do in the midst of my job like

4119
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:59,870
when I hand the hand the new device we

4121
01:35:57,410 --> 01:36:03,230
need still working on a name but the the

4123
01:35:59,870 --> 01:36:05,690
portable stem player to my daughter and

4125
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:07,370
she's playing it and then she turns down

4127
01:36:05,690 --> 01:36:10,820
the vocals and turns up the vocal her

4129
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:14,090
eyes light up this is feeling her eyes

4131
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:15,830
light up the way Jays eyes used to light

4133
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:17,390
up when I would come and play him a beat

4135
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:19,010
and that mean everything to at the time

4137
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:20,690
that was that was everything you were

4139
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:23,120
striving for at that moment in time that

4141
01:36:20,690 --> 01:36:25,580
validation now the validation comes from

4143
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:29,870
your family well I don't know if it's

4145
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:31,820
about a validation as more it's not

4147
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:34,730
about validation it's about the light

4149
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:36,560
seeing Jay's face light up when I would

4151
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:40,370
play on those beats and now seeing

4153
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:42,380
North's face light up when she's playing

4155
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:44,390
with the device that we just created

4157
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:46,280
what is this device he keeps talking we

4159
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:50,879
go go back to studio we'll play it like

4161
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:54,219
but ticks in general are dark

4163
01:36:50,879 --> 01:36:58,389
music has more of ability to be light

4165
01:36:54,219 --> 01:37:01,629
similar to Tesla I'm about lighting the

4167
01:36:58,389 --> 01:37:04,019
world up about being a light being a

4169
01:37:01,629 --> 01:37:06,760
beacon and having other people

4171
01:37:04,019 --> 01:37:08,859
experience joy through what we create

4173
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:11,769
whether they're holding the product that

4175
01:37:08,859 --> 01:37:13,989
we create or experience a Sunday service

4177
01:37:11,769 --> 01:37:17,109
or when they used to come to the tours

4179
01:37:13,989 --> 01:37:19,719
and see the imagination someone up there

4181
01:37:17,109 --> 01:37:22,329
with a mask on it

4183
01:37:19,719 --> 01:37:24,219
it's not about entertainment as more as

4185
01:37:22,329 --> 01:37:29,760
it's not about entertainment it's about

4187
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:34,629
imagination witness the imagination and

4189
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:37,689
feel good feel know that things are

4191
01:37:34,629 --> 01:37:42,280
possible know that things that you feel

4193
01:37:37,689 --> 01:37:44,469
are possible that's what that's my job

4195
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:46,089
that's what I'm here to do to do things

4197
01:37:44,469 --> 01:37:48,129
you're like oh I didn't know that's why

4199
01:37:46,089 --> 01:37:49,239
we got to go and take this shirt out on

4201
01:37:48,129 --> 01:37:52,479
the lake so you can see that this thing

4203
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:55,899
literally drives on the lake and that it

4205
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:58,329
is possible for these to do that the and

4207
01:37:55,899 --> 01:38:00,489
I think that that I think this is a good

4209
01:37:58,329 --> 01:38:04,539
thing this anchor about you know

4211
01:38:00,489 --> 01:38:06,339
comparing these moments of also the way

4213
01:38:04,539 --> 01:38:09,849
people hear a reason why I love doing

4215
01:38:06,339 --> 01:38:11,859
listening sessions is to be close to all

4217
01:38:09,849 --> 01:38:14,109
these people here and the way they felt

4219
01:38:11,859 --> 01:38:16,570
when they first see the light yeah we

4221
01:38:14,109 --> 01:38:18,879
see the light you know whereas when an

4223
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:20,679
album is like release mass wide you can

4225
01:38:18,879 --> 01:38:22,419
kind of hear views coming back or you

4227
01:38:20,679 --> 01:38:23,050
hear people driving down the street that

4229
01:38:22,419 --> 01:38:27,659
feels good

4231
01:38:23,050 --> 01:38:34,030
yeah it's there's a communal element to

4233
01:38:27,659 --> 01:38:36,039
music that streaming helps and it's

4235
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:39,579
actually it takes away from it a little

4237
01:38:36,039 --> 01:38:42,609
bits like video killed the radio star

4239
01:38:39,579 --> 01:38:44,379
streaming killed the videostar HSP

4241
01:38:42,609 --> 01:38:46,149
hypersensitive people yeah I never heard

4243
01:38:44,379 --> 01:38:48,489
that term before do you think that that

4245
01:38:46,149 --> 01:38:50,019
is the thing that you're most

4247
01:38:48,489 --> 01:38:51,280
misunderstood about and the way that

4249
01:38:50,019 --> 01:38:53,439
you've been perceived and treated is

4251
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:57,189
that is that people ignored or perhaps

4253
01:38:53,439 --> 01:39:00,010
didn't I understand your sensitivity

4255
01:38:57,189 --> 01:39:04,059
levels yeah I also but I also fell as a

4257
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:06,610
camouflage if the system

4259
01:39:04,059 --> 01:39:08,679
that supported kanye west's had any idea

4261
01:39:06,610 --> 01:39:10,869
that I would make it to that telethon or

4263
01:39:08,679 --> 01:39:12,699
make it to that Taylor Swift stage or

4265
01:39:10,869 --> 01:39:16,389
make it to be the founder of this three

4267
01:39:12,699 --> 01:39:19,329
billion dollar company they would have

4269
01:39:16,389 --> 01:39:21,820
injected it with drugs way earlier they

4271
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:24,159
would have tried to do anything to stop

4273
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:25,630
it earlier but it's too late so it's

4275
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:30,789
been a camouflage and even right now as

4277
01:39:25,630 --> 01:39:34,840
I speak there's a a wash of arrogance

4279
01:39:30,789 --> 01:39:37,479
that because I've been diagnosed with

4281
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:38,979
mental health because I am black because

4283
01:39:37,479 --> 01:39:41,349
I've been positioned in this

4285
01:39:38,979 --> 01:39:42,820
entertainment field because I've had a

4287
01:39:41,349 --> 01:39:49,239
red half of all these different things

4289
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:54,190
it it makes I'm you know when I talk

4291
01:39:49,239 --> 01:39:58,570
it's a dog whistle because the people

4293
01:39:54,190 --> 01:40:01,179
who need to hear it hear it and the

4295
01:39:58,570 --> 01:40:02,979
people who don't need to hear it that

4297
01:40:01,179 --> 01:40:05,979
should be afraid of it are too much

4299
01:40:02,979 --> 01:40:07,780
bigots they're too much of bigots too

4301
01:40:05,979 --> 01:40:09,280
Annamma say too much bigots because the

4303
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:12,999
use of incorrect English is also a

4305
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:16,659
common it's also a camouflage yeah there

4307
01:40:12,999 --> 01:40:18,880
are too much bigots to believe that it

4309
01:40:16,659 --> 01:40:24,639
could happen Bernard Arnault

4311
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:27,909
doesn't believe that the kid that had a

4313
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:30,309
backpack on will be standing across the

4315
01:40:27,909 --> 01:40:34,150
stadium from jay-z the greatest rapper

4381
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:04,170
amount of courts that I've listened to

4383
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:05,910
in the past year alone like an off time

4385
01:42:04,170 --> 01:42:07,620
even when I was doing five albums in a

4387
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:11,670
row I was like old it's just like LeBron

4389
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:13,890
James back on the treadmill ya know

4391
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:15,060
that's you know just that that five

4393
01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:18,210
hours was a part of my rehabilitation

4395
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:20,010
from coming from the hospital think

4397
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:22,080
about like when I was at Nike when I was

4399
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:24,510
at Nike there wasn't no virtue there

4401
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:27,780
wasn't no drag there was no Travis that

4403
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:29,790
was it was just like yay graduation and

4405
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:31,530
then when I left you know I had a brand

4407
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:37,260
antisocial social club they made the

4409
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:43,080
anti Calle Calle Club and Nike other

4411
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:44,310
versions to be airtight Kanye someone's

4413
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:47,550
gonna watch this and they're gonna start

4415
01:42:44,310 --> 01:42:48,870
- it was gonna be an official anti Kanye

4417
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:50,969
Kanye Club trust me

4419
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:54,390
okay and they made the Pro Jesus Jesus

4421
01:42:50,969 --> 01:42:55,679
Club then they gonna make a pro Jesus

4423
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:59,010
Jesus Club they're gonna make it bread

4425
01:42:55,679 --> 01:43:02,280
Jesus Jesus but I go to the hotels and

4427
01:42:59,010 --> 01:43:08,540
everything you're gonna build man well

4429
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:14,130
and building it for us other people's

4431
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:17,219
families not just no to building it for

4433
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:19,080
us for everyone just innovating thinking

4435
01:43:17,219 --> 01:43:21,540
why does that plug have to go into that

4437
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:23,850
wall like that wallet what is this room

4439
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:26,310
this far away why is this couch design

4441
01:43:23,850 --> 01:43:27,719
like this what's your life's work now

4443
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:30,030
from this point forward it is your

4445
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:33,810
life's work

4447
01:43:30,030 --> 01:43:36,270
creatively it's what I am interested in

4449
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:38,490
expressing but it will only be expressed

4451
01:43:36,270 --> 01:43:41,640
if it's in God's will because if God

4453
01:43:38,490 --> 01:43:44,280
wants me to build these factories they

4455
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:46,350
shall be built and if God says that's

4457
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:49,230
not what I want you to do yeah yeah I

4459
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:56,550
want you to go I want you to sit in jail

4461

I want you to go to Sydney Africa for

4463
01:43:56,550 --> 01:44:00,750
this amount of time for this reason I

4465
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:02,910
want you I don't know what God has

4467
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:05,220
planned a surrendering of control in

4469
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:07,080
your whole life is being about control

4471
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:09,120
exactly think about that it could go

4473
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:12,300
from being they said whatever God has

4475
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:15,150
planned that I am ready to be in service

4477
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:17,760
to God and whatever he has planned for

4479
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:19,100

bit on on some of the some of the folks

4501
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:46,200

ups and downs with my health people

4609
01:47:04,629 --> 01:47:10,189
calling me crazy people not wanting to

4611
01:47:08,329 --> 01:47:12,289
sit and meet with me and this all this

4613
01:47:10,189 --> 01:47:16,599
has happened I had to just give it all

4615
01:47:12,289 --> 01:47:19,699
up to God and not use any of you know

4617
01:47:16,599 --> 01:47:21,169
the tacticity you know even like let's

4619
01:47:19,699 --> 01:47:22,519
say I'll be known as my new Drake and

4621
01:47:21,169 --> 01:47:24,919
all this kind of hotlines or whatever

4623
01:47:22,519 --> 01:47:28,389
it's like no we got to go in and say

4625
01:47:24,919 --> 01:47:32,359
that it's all in God's hands it's just

4627
01:47:28,389 --> 01:47:34,609
praying when you pray things don't

4629
01:47:32,359 --> 01:47:36,800
always happen exactly when you want them

4631
01:47:34,609 --> 01:47:39,829
to happen there's is a God's time it's

4633
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:42,109
not in your time and God may have you

4635
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:43,879
suffer to use you to show you something

4637
01:47:42,109 --> 01:47:46,099
to show someone else something that's

4639
01:47:43,879 --> 01:47:48,320
God why do I have to suffer why don't I

4641
01:47:46,099 --> 01:47:54,349
have to go through this night but it's a

4643
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:56,300
bit as a part of a bigger plan so where

4645
01:47:54,349 --> 01:47:59,070
does that leave push

4647
01:47:56,300 --> 01:48:01,650
pushes coming along but I can't speak I

4649
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:06,990
can't speak on his journey and his walk

4651
01:48:01,650 --> 01:48:10,320
but he know he knows God is real you

4653
01:48:06,990 --> 01:48:14,460
know there's there's things where people

4655
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:16,860
know God is real but the tangible and

4657
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:19,890
the physical things are so in front of

4659
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:22,440
us and Cuddy on reborn which is an

4661
01:48:19,890 --> 01:48:23,040
important moment of kids in ghosts right

4663
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:24,900
mm-hmm

4665
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:26,250
that's a song that ultimately set you on

4667
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:27,330
the path even though that record came

4669
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:29,820
out you were still on your way to

4671
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:33,600
Chicago to denounce Jesus the

4673
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:35,040
interesting timeline for that yeah it's

4675
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:37,290
interesting that it's reborn because

4677
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:39,690
Cuddy's not Christian and I wasn't and

4679
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:42,780
you would and yet that song was almost a

4681
01:48:39,690 --> 01:48:44,100
declaration of yeah eight months I don't

4683
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:45,420
know if it said I think I was in the

4685
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:47,210
path since I was born

4687
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:50,820
god I've always had me on this path and

4689
01:48:47,210 --> 01:48:53,130
you know after surrounded myself with

4691
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:57,330
Sunday service with all of these

4693
01:48:53,130 --> 01:49:04,950
god-fearing god-loving people singing

4695
01:48:57,330 --> 01:49:09,150
you know I really had a luxury soundwave

4697
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:11,730
treatment to show me how God is so good

4699
01:49:09,150 --> 01:49:15,450
and I was led with light and it's funny

4701
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:17,730
because God led me with light to him but

4703
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:19,770
then I'll turn around and be screaming

4705
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:22,140
and other people that are not in the

4707
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:24,150
same place in their journey you know

4709
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:25,040
pointing fingers and being judgmental

4711
01:49:24,150 --> 01:49:29,460
and you're over that now

4713
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:32,370
to a degree I'm still human I still hurt

4715
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:34,260
I still get mad but it's interesting Jo

4717
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:36,810
drugs in the studio no alcohol in the

4719
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:42,330
studio can you be around that stuff all

4721
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:44,760
alcohol but yeah no but some people you

4723
01:49:42,330 --> 01:49:46,710
know I have a medical condition where

4725
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:51,630
they have to smoke weed mm-hmm and

4727
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:53,340
you're okay with that well yeah you

4729
01:49:51,630 --> 01:49:55,680
saying what do I condone on a property

4731
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:59,640
inside of my studio specifically mm-hmm

4733
01:49:55,680 --> 01:50:01,890
you know I'm early on into the walk and

4735
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:05,160
I believe that there's certain things

4737
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:06,810
that haven't been defined completely but

4739
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:08,520
definitely I mean we never have people

4741
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:09,240
doing hard drugs in our in our studio

4743
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:13,590
yeah any

4745
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:17,820
way whenever I've never seen someone do

4747
01:50:13,590 --> 01:50:19,820
cocaine in a studio of mine I never seen

4749
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:24,750
anyone smoke crack I've never seen

4751
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:26,700
anyone do heroin but pills are a friend

4753
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:31,800
of heroin there

4755
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:36,180
it's a oxy cognizant opioid so I

4757
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:38,940
remember you know having surgery and

4759
01:50:36,180 --> 01:50:40,440
then having the painkiller and then

4761
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:43,290
after the pain was gone I'd still be

4763
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:45,840
popping the pills that maybe taken more

4765
01:50:43,290 --> 01:50:50,280
than one and the feeling that thing that

4767
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:54,810
set off it's a similar feeling to when

4769
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:58,140
you climax so that shows you why sex is

4771
01:50:54,810 --> 01:51:00,960
just as much a powerful drug as opioid

4773
01:50:58,140 --> 01:51:03,690
whereas heroin yeah so when you saw me

4775
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:05,940
at the MTV Awards the year after my mama

4777
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:07,920
had passed that was like if I was a

4779
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:09,240
heroin addict with the needle and a

4781
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:12,530
heroin addict with the needle coming out

4783
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:15,020
of my arm like I don't really care about

4785
01:51:12,530 --> 01:51:20,630
living anymore

4787
01:51:15,020 --> 01:51:25,350
and I just thank God for saving me

4789
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:30,630
physically mentally spiritually yeah my

4791
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:36,080
last question is um at this point in

4793
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:40,320
your life at 42 and being a man of faith

4795
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:44,520
serving God spreading the gospel have

4797
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:46,020
you been able to find peace with the

4799
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:47,850
challenges of your life that you didn't

4801
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:51,720
bring up on yourself the loss of your

4803
01:51:47,850 --> 01:51:53,850
mum the exposure to pornography at a

4805
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:57,800
young age the things that set you on

4807
01:51:53,850 --> 01:51:57,800
your path that you've had to process

4809
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:15,440
yes I'm at peace its I give it all up to

4811
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:18,260
God it's sometimes we will sit around

4813
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:22,580
and start to get mad about something or

4815
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:24,949
um you know about to scream about

4817
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:28,190
something and I'm rude you know I had a

4819
01:52:24,949 --> 01:52:31,040
rude I have a rude spirit and I had a

4821
01:52:28,190 --> 01:52:32,750
rude spirit that I need to work on grace

4823
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:36,730
a lot of people there's things that they

4825
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:39,710
need to work on man I am like just

4827
01:52:36,730 --> 01:52:41,690
prepped to be a Christian you know you

4829

Smita stall and say oh do you play balls

4833
01:52:43,489 --> 01:52:47,360
is that you just take everything about

4835
01:52:45,889 --> 01:52:48,920
my personality but like all you would

4837
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:50,119
make a perfect Christian don't you want

4839
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:51,619
to hold on to someone that fight isn't

4841
01:52:50,119 --> 01:52:53,780
that fine needed don't need some of that

don't mean you ain't got fight I mean

4849
01:52:57,199 --> 01:53:00,380
the rudeness let me be more specific

4851
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:02,929
well that's what I've got to say the

4853
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:07,580
thing I pray for to be more christ-like

4855
01:53:02,929 --> 01:53:11,449
is the grace is its I have to pray for

4857
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:14,540
grace and then as God strengthens my

4859
01:53:11,449 --> 01:53:17,679
hand is to have more grace like we as

4861
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:21,920
human beings inside of the game of life

4863
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:24,050
do there's a disability where I might be

4865
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,409
slightly upset about something later

4867
01:53:24,050 --> 01:53:28,130
today

4869
01:53:24,409 --> 01:53:31,369
I pray that but doesn't seem to go about

4871
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:33,949
two days didn't something new to be hah

4873
01:53:31,369 --> 01:53:38,360
I'm upset about that these are like new

4875
01:53:33,949 --> 01:53:40,400
challenges that we're at with life it's

4877
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:43,550
completely landscape has changed around

4879
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:46,520
here taking you know meetings and doing

4881
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:49,460
partnerships on building factories and

building our own farms and in these new

4885
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:52,219
challenges there will be things you're

4887
01:53:50,989 --> 01:53:53,690
frustrated about it's like if you went

4889
01:53:52,219 --> 01:53:57,530
to different levels of the video game

4891
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:59,300
like I'm less frustrated about the snare

4893
01:53:57,530 --> 01:54:00,949
or a hi-hat I've been doing that so long

4895
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:02,960

everything we've got that completely

4901
01:54:05,179 --> 01:54:11,300
under control I don't have any idea you

4903
01:54:07,790 --> 01:54:13,040

4905
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:14,630
have experience doing the things I'm

4907
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:16,580
talking about yeah yeah and in that

4909
01:54:14,630 --> 01:54:19,820
experience there's gonna be some cuts

4911
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:21,170
and some bruises but I'm ready to go in

4913
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:21,559
it's one of those like jumping in the

4915
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:26,209
deep

4917
01:54:21,559 --> 01:54:28,039
and things like if you knew how you know

4919
01:54:26,209 --> 01:54:31,429
difficult certain things where you might

4921
01:54:28,039 --> 01:54:33,260
not jump in to be able to receive be

4923
01:54:31,429 --> 01:54:37,550
able to receive how rewarding they are

4925
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:39,379
on the other end and we we in the

4927
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:41,709
defense we always stay we stay in deeper

4929
01:54:39,379 --> 01:54:45,489
I'm not shallow I'm deep Oh muck

4931
01:54:41,709 --> 01:54:45,489
everything's gonna be on the deep in
