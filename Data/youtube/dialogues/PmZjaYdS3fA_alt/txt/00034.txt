i think people focus too much on the past and focus too much on regret
even like when you deal with schools
like you take like the slave idea
my point is i ve heard of history class
i ve never heard of a class that breaks down how you you know balance a checkbook or how you control your finances which my father never taught me that
and i ve never heard of a future class
so they keep us so focused on history that we start to believe that it actually repeats itself
and we become overly traditional
and we can t advance as a race of beings
we get too caught up in the past and what everyone s saying and what everyone s tweeting
and sometimes you just have to be fearless enough to break the simulation
when i say simulation that s what i mean by s imulation
sorry i know you guys wanted to clap but everything i m going to say is going to be amazing
here s the idea why you re in a simulation
let s start with acting first of all
a 2-year-old screams at a restaurant the entire restaurant screams teach that kid how to act
we re all unpaid actors in some giant script that we didn t write
simulation
a 2-year-old jumps on a coffee table and someone says that s a coffee table don t jump on that
so it went from being something that makes him feel like superman he s got his cape on to something where he has to think about in the person s like a family member he s 2 years old doesn t give a about a coffee or a table
he s starting to like calculate all these things
by the time you re 40 years old you ve got a wall full of coffee tables calculating you into cla traffic calculating you into your career choice calculating you into this townhouse that s not quite as big as the townhouse next and it just never works
that s the simulation that i m talking about
that s what i mean when i say simulation
