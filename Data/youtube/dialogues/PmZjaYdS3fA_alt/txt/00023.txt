well you know
it s funny you know
in this world that we live in there s two main motivating forces
and i tweet about it all the time
it s love or fear
and you can t explain love
you know my cousin is locked up for murder
and i love him
so he did a bad thing but i still love him
and just as a musician african-american guy out in hollywood all these different things you know everyone around me tried to pick my candidate for me
and then told me every time i said i liked trump that i couldn t say it out loud or my career would be over i d get kicked out of the black community because blacks are supposed to have a monolithic thought we can only be democrats and all
so
even when i said it right before i went to the hospital and i expressed myself and when i came out i had lost my confidence
so i didn t have the confidence to take on the world and the possible backlash
and it took me a year and a half to have the confidence to stand up and put on the hat
no matter what the consequences were
and what it represented to me is nothing about policies because i m not a politician like that but it represented overcoming fear and doing what you felt no matter what anyone said in saying you can t bully me
liberals can t bully me news can t bully me the hip-hop community they can t bully me
at that point if i m afraid to be me i m no longer ye
that s what makes ye
i actually quite enjoy when people actually are mad at me about certain things
