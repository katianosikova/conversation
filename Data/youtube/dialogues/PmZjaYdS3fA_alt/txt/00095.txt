yeah
i have a team we worked together
i spent a year and a half after i got out of the hospital
and i would go to amoeba record store and start chopping up samples
it s very therapeutic because i wasn t full ye
i don t know if i m full ye now better or worse or whatever
but it was therapeutic just to listen to those songs and sample and go back to being 14 years old at my mom s house
and by the time it s time to do
to put the albums out we have a whole team at yeezy sound that will help come and do the drums help with lyrics help with choruses
i had to give like six seven people ideas that i want on the song
and i d just go to sleep and just wait for them
