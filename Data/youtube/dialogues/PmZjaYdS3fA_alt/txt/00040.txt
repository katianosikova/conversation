but one of the things i think gets missed on tmz is the main thing i was stressing is the idea of trying love
you know we re always you know
pushing out so much hate and love can cure so much
just to think am i moving in love
is this out of love
not out of pride
pride is a word people say in a positive connotation but it s actually one of the seven deadly sins
it takes too much ownership
you can replace pride with love
and when i see people just even like go at the president it s like why not try love
for one person to stand up against all odds and just hug somebody the way that alice johnson hugged her family when she got out of jail
that one by one by one we can defuse this nuclear bomb of hate that we re in as a society by thinking of everyone as our family
and how would we treat our kids
how would we treat
