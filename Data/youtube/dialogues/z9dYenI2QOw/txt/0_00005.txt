you know at my lowest point you know god was there with me and sending me visions and inspiring me
and i remember sitting in the hospital at ucla after having a mental breakdown and there s documentations of me drawing a church and saying writing start a church in the middle of calabasas and even after that i went and made the the life of pablo album
i said this is a gospel album and i didn t know how to totally make a gospel album and the christians that were around where too i would say beaten into submission by society and not speak up and profess the gospel to you know
to me because i was a superstar but the only superstar is jesus
