well my dad had me in church three times a week
for me as a kid you know going to church on wednesday instead of going to basketball practice or getting to play video games got to be you know a little bit boring
and my mom had me in church twice a week or definitely on sundays
we actually grew with the church it was a pastor named johnny coleman and we grew from a small church to a mega church a chicago version
i think it grew to like five 6 000
and my mom always had the records in the house and we would be playing a lot of r b records but then we d go and hear the gospel and hear worship
so you know as i now have a family i m 42 years old and married for five years
