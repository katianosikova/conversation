god is not the enemy god is not the negative part
god is not just a perception of fire and brimstone god is love is the greatest is the glory
god is family
god is friendship god is prosperity
keep our eye on the sparrow keep your eye on the beauty and the love and the grace of god
the grace that allows us to be here today with all of our sins
