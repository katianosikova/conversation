a couple more because i wanna stay on that kanye because it s not just about turning over a new leaf
it s not just about you know being good or being positive it s about a personal relationship with jesus
knowing that he died for our sins we repent of those sins and we say god i m gonna walk with you
you know kanye you can speak to that i don t know if you wanna pray for the people or i ll pray for them or however you wanna do that
but let s just make sure you know the main point is what you stand for is not just you ve turned over a new leaf
you told james corden and i don t wanna steal your words but james corden said well how do we know kanye is just not you know it s just not for a minute or something like that
you said you know when you re asleep that s one state
when you wake up that s another state and kanye said i woke up to god so i m awake now so i love that
