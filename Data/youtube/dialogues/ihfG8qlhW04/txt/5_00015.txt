like i ve never experienced before
when i worked at nike or any other big corporations you re a cog behind a desk and it s preprogrammed with oh we re gonna have a focus group
well get a brief
we ll pitch it to management
10 people will decided what we re gonna do from there and then you ll do four more sketches and then 10 other people will decide on that and then we ll show it around and get people s feel for it and it just takes forever
and with ye it s just like go and we create and it s like nothing else
you can t describe it till you re in it
it s magic what i hear a lot talking to designers is
