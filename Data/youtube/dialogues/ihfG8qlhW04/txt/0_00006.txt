and you know it was
i remember you said to me like did they ever make this
i m like no
he goes what the hell is wrong with them
all this stuff is amazing
let s make all the things you ve always wanted to make that they were too stupid to make
i m like let s go and the final design it was ye myself and a young chinese kid ding and for 48 hours straight i ll never forget it
we passed sketches and tests and people are now saying ding s name to the entire shoe industry
it s a he can get all the calls
and so 48 hours straight he and i texted emailed whatever sketches back and forth and they were photoshopped and i would redraw it and send it back to him
we d take this part and put that part out and mix it up and it was like nothing i had ever done before and it was just mind blowing and exhausting
and finally i told ye dude it s two o clock in the morning and i m old
i gotta go to bed
and out of it came that last one to me and after 48 hours boom this thing came out and it was an amazing experience like nothing i had ever done before and i m like yeah this is cool
and that s that shoe you re wearing right now
yeah
and when it dropped i mean the thing sold out in six and a half minutes which was incredible
i mean who wouldn t wanna be part of that magic you know
and it s continued ever since
