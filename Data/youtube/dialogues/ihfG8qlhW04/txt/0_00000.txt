hello everyone
thanks for coming out
i think everyone knows who my guest is and we also have steven smith lead designer of yeezy who unless you re a sneaker head you might not know that well
so we should probably all realize now yeezy is a multibillion dollar brand
it did something like 1
5 billion dollars in sales last year
it s wholly owned by kanye west and the two of them kanye and steven came together a few years ago
met up and sort of lead yeezy design now and what i wanna do today is have a conversation about that
no one s really dug into the nuts and bolts of yeezy design yet and so let s start with how did you find each other
