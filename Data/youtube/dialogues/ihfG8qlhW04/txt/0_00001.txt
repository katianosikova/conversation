oh you know i had
i was working for another company and i was head of innovation and it wasn t innovative and i walked away one day
which people are like you just left your job
i m like yeah it just wasn t it and so for two weeks my wife s like what are you gonna do
i m like i don t know
but i wasn t doing that anymore
and then one night the phone rang and it was ye and it started from there
i looked at it as a blessing
you know i was in a kind of a dark place and this hand reached out and pulled me to the light and pulled me from the depths to the top and it s been an amazing experience ever since
i was just saying to ye this morning
it s like the last time i was in new york was the time you flew me out to meet you in person the first time
so it s just been amazing
if i had known that you had just left your job i wouldn t have spent two hours tryin to talk you into coming to yeezy
