and see past it
see past this theater that we live in that social media greatly controls
and it s so funny to me
oh it s so obvious
why wouldn t it be there
when i was first doing my first fashion show in paris
everyone said well the olsens started with a t shirt
you should start with a t shirt
i don t want to do a t shirt
i want to do a fashion show in paris
as a matter of fact i don t want to i m gonna do it and it s done and it s so
the life is i don t know if you saw that venus williams interview where this guy was asking how do you feel about this match
does anybody know the interview that i m talkin about
this youtube clip
and she says oh i m gonna win
and they say the guy says well what makes you so confident
and then the father her father came in and said she s gonna win cuz she said she was gonna win
martin luther king didn t get killed because of i have a dream
he had something else he was gonna talk about
black empowerment
economic empowerment
so you know when i did the forbes and i showed him an 890 million dollar receipt and they still didn t say billionaire
they don t want us to know that we can buy land
they don t want us to have the 100 ownership that i have 100 ownership at yeezy
and the reason i say these things out loud in this way is so i won t be killed
i said it out loud already
