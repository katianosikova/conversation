jimmy first of all thanks for being here and thank you for the shoes
nobody ever brings me shoes you brought me shoes that s very nice of you very kind
i ll tell you a story and this is honestly true
the last time a few years ago you sent me a pair of yeezys
i have never in my life had more people come up and talk to me than when i was walking around in them to the point where i was like this is crazy i ve got to get these off people are chasing me
i m worried people are going to beat me up and take these
usually people wait i ve seen them sleeping on the street waiting for these shoes
is that for you more rewarding than hearing people say they like your music
both
jimmy it s both yeah
sometimes it s like the thing you are accustomed to hearing and you start hearing something
