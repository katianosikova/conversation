history class
i ve never heard of a class that breaks down how you you know balance a checkbook or how you control your finances which my father never taught me that
and i ve never heard of a future class
so they keep us so focused on history that we start to believe that it actually repeats itself
and we become overly traditional
and we can t advance as a race of beings
we get too caught up in the past and what everyone s saying and what everyone s tweeting
