i think i was like going through now like my version of my terrible twos
my my daughter she wants to express herself but she just doesn t have the words for it
and for me there s so many things i wanna do with film with clothing and i just didn t have the words or the resources or the backing or the perception that i could do it being that i was a rapper or you know all these things
and now because of this adidas deal they allowed me a little bit of oxygen
because what you have to understand the difference between you know what people give you about celebrity the idea of money versus creativity
there s no amount of money that someone can give you to make you not be creative if you were born to create
so a lot of times people try to block you block your creativity control you with money
and adidas allowed me to make my whole clothing line which i wanted to do and it was just like a little bit of oxygen
you guys last year two years ago three whatever
you guys were seeing someone being suffocated by a perception
being suffocated by people in a position that could blatantly see like wow the yeezus did really good
he was this influential
all those albums did this
but we re not gonna give him a shot in something else
and there s a lot of people who like were really calm about that
but the definition of crazy is trying to do the same thing and expecting a different result
so i tried something different over the past couple years
and i actually got some really good results from it too so
yeah
well
well put
well put
and that is true
i mean i think we all try to express ourselves
and you do you keep doing the same thing and saying the same thing and saying the same thing
it doesn t get the result you want until you try a different way of expressing yourself or whatever it is and then you get the result because you ve shifted
we have to take a break
and then we re gonna show the world premiere of your new video which i absolutely love
i love this song so much
you actually played it for me in our living room and i just was blown away how beautiful the song is
so uh more kids
