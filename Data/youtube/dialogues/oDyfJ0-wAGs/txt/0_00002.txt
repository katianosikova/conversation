beautiful
and i ve learned how to shut up more and um i ve yeah
i think i think i m a better human being you know because of her and because of my daughter
mm hmm
and i have you know always someone to think about going home to and you know something for me to you know not only be brave for what i wanna do for humanity but also to be more protective of myself for my family too
cause there s things i ve done in the past that were considered negative but i was really you know jumping in front of the tank for other people or for culture in a way
so now i always have to have that in my mind that i have like a family that i have to protect too
mm hmm
yeah and i do see that change in you
