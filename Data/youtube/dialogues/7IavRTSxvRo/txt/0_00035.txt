what s your feelings on well you know i like the fact that he kept the name alive and put him into the limelight but i always had a problem that he said his name and then was said whipping work you know i mean and he s fighting for his life so i wouldn t want him to speak on him about whipping work and him and drugs his federal case that he s dealing with right now is a drug case you know i mean he has five or six life sentences i don t know the exact number but it doesn t matter because both of them is horrible yeah but under the first step back he deserves to come home off with a he deserves to come home and he qualifies to come home right but it s the judge s discretion for whatever reason he don t feel like he should be able to come home at this point but he qualifies to come home
