with my time saying should i be even taking a meeting like when i take a meeting this i know if it s a good or bad meeting if someone s talking to me and i just get sleepy i know that that s not what i should do but if someone s talking i m you know energized i like saying the word energize over the word excited because this is what they do to this is what they do to all of us they get us excited excited and anxiety they kind of go together like someone can say hey i got you a new car um and it s across the street you get so excited you run across the street get hit by a car trying to run to your new but if you re energized about having the car perhaps you look both ways see i played this dictionary game with the like this uh um this small webster pocket dictionary and we ll go to a page and say go to page with the word help on it and we say highlight all the words you think are positive and then we talk about afterwards why do you think that s positive so the word help is like it s like a uh it s like a bad leg on a table you think you could stand on it but if you stand right there that table could flip over the fourth definition in the word help is to ignore and it actually makes sense you know oh like if you have a meeting right here s the answer when you know the meeting didn t go do good
