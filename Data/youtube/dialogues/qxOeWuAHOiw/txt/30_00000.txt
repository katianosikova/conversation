transportation so at the school that i just created easy christian academy you know we call nasa we call different places about this hydroponic vertical growing uh garden and i remember sitting you know the idea of the garden is from a to z you have to be able to make your food right there fully sustainable right there on your land and you know there s a bunch of people like oh i made this salad right here it s like i m not that good enough you still gotta go to the grocery store for eighty percent sixty percent of your stuff i remember this one you know um this one farmer we had you know he wanted to build this class for the kids and all this we re going to show the kids this thing people always make the kids version i don t like this the kids version thing like kids need to understand how what if the pandemic was you know they lost all their parents and it was lost the kids need to understand early how real life works so physics is one of the anchors of the school that i m creating i remember you know i m uh the city is all self sustaining so it works off of our four main resources earth wind uh water and and fire and uh 90 of it is running off of water with like aqueducts like the city of masada and i was talking to this engineer um and saying i need the whole thing to run off of water and he said well we re gonna have to use solar power i said i don t and please you know don t take this as any offense i don t like solar panels i feel that they re part of still of what edison s idea was i don t feel like they re really in line with what nikolai tesla really wanted to do with alternative current i mean getting into the whole tesla and what edison did to take tesla down and the fact the world would probably be free by now if ted if tesla wasn t basically destroyed by the media that edison controlled in the propaganda that edison control so i m i m talking to my engineer and saying this needs to run completely with water and i don t want to use uh a solar anyway and he says no i m saying we re going to use a mirror and it s going to connect to a steam uh engine and that s going to push the water back up and i was like after like screaming at the guy i was like look if i had known physics i wouldn t have been screaming at my engineer so if we think about what we re learning in school to learn physics
