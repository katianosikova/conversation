you mean by your own understanding meaning when people ask einstein said you re the smartest person what would you like to know he his einstein s response was i d like to understand the mind of god meaning meaning god is all knowing and we can only know or see and for me as a visionary we can only know or see what god allows us to see and what he feels we re ready to see and understand to to maximize what our mass laws hierarchy and e chart is you know what sets our dopa means what sets our serotonins off what makes us feel good basically like you know we we did a good deed and it s like it was somehow where you know you know just doing a beat for a famous per or just doing a beat for um a local dope rapper really meant a lot to me when i was 14 years old doing a beat for just anyone famous that had a major record deal was a lot to me at age 19
me being able to you know put out my own music and put my own i was a lot to me at age 24 meaning as i grow god sets new stages in the game of life for me that you get your satisfaction like maslow s hierarchy of need is like our satisfaction chart what makes us feel whole and uh accomplished as a as a as a human being so as i go through these different levels there s times where i would use confidence when i knew what i was doing and i would use arrogance when i didn t know what i was doing but i d rather use arrogance than to let someone diminish my idea of myself because that is what keeps us going hope actually keeps us alive anybody you ask most people is like do you want tomorrow to come and they say yes they have they have hope for it but i went from having confidence and arrogance to having faith and faith is the opposite of fear and that created this fearless approach that i have and that s what made now has made me the fearless leader that i am that i ve like crystallized into the leader that my mom always knew i would be when kids followed me in preschool the leader that people saw when we changed the sound of music the leader when we changed uh the the sneaker industry the leader and what we re doing with uh with farming and with with shelters when i was building you know the homeless shelters uh a couple years ago and visiting parks and and then going to skip row and understanding the uh uh the dynamics and empathizing with what actual mental health issues are not someone you know telling their truth or being exhausted and then being labeled as such like i am so that s what you felt happened to you like you were absolutely truth and you were exhausted and they labeled you as mentally unhealthy yes absolutely am i saying this right that what happened with you is you feel like maybe or you probably feel like that having this higher calling and recognizing this higher power was the the glue that kept your thoughts together they kept your mind straight
