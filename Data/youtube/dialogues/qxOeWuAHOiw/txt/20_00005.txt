so he said my son wants to hear a rap album from yay and that just that was that was the paradigm shift for me i used that word a lot i like that i like paradigm shift it s one of my favorite the and i i made this rap album and you know for a lot of people it was the first album that they could play with a certain production level in the house with their with their with their family now you know you could argue if the watch the throne production was stronger or better than uh jesus king production but when i go and i like i ve been working with dr dre and some of the beats and just be like you know the hardest beats possible and it s something that was very spiritual and meditative about the mix on jesus king that it wasn t hitting as hard as jesus or hitting as hard as uh watch the throne it was like this is how god wanted me to make this uh make this sonic painting and the way he wanted me to communicate then so we did that album and then we did the jesus s born album which also i got that idea from pastor adams
