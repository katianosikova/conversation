is a a um is a contract that my friend the head of dropbox used um and that a lot of tech guys use and it s a standardized deal so one of the ideas i had when i was um as i m in this process of innovating i m not i m not in war with the music industry it s just it s time for us to innovate uh and we need to have contracts that make sense with exactly how we sell music so you know people every vicinia and that s like uh every 20 years that s like the like decade is 10 vicinia is 20
and as you see now it s like the world is just stopped for a second and there s an opportunity to look and say what are the things we need what are the things we don t need so i don t know if you saw when i posted my contract i had 10 contracts that kept on putting me inside a labyrinth and there s things that we don t need now
