yes that s a beautiful thing to say right there and it s also probably the first sound biteable thing that i ve said the entire all right let me talk to you about so we re serious here so let s talk about like real presidential issues let s talk about like here s here s some things that just when we talk about this country here s some things that are that mean a lot to me one student debt i think it s crazy i think it s crazy that we take children when they re 17 18 years old we send them way to college we make them literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and then we ask them to go out into the world and try to manage this money and and try to get a job that s going to pay them a fraction of what they owe for their education i think it s crazy i think we should figure out a way to absolve student debt i think we should figure out a way to make education at the very least far less expensive
