uh and i mean there s people who that s the only album they play and it s just bringing these gospel and i tell you like my formula for these hymns i m writing because i m writing the the songs that we re doing at uh sunday service is basically my book of hymns for the future gospel university that i m creating where i ve envisioned and will manifest a 200 000 seat stadium circular with a hundred thousand gospel singers and people will go to this university and they will train the way you know a russian olympic swimmer you know a picture like they would be in the pool six days a week at least if not seven days but for people who sing for the church or you know uh you know because it s it s it s a tide it s pro bonus all this like people don t practice that as much as we practice going to studio to rap or practice uh playing basketball if we re in the nba so it s making the nba sort of say uh the coliseum for god and what that have have you like heard like soccer chants and like and just like sixty thousand persons so i envisioned that for god a hundred thousand people sometimes singing in uh harmony sometimes in unison glory glory oh god almighty we lift our hands and give you praise glory glory oh god almighty we lift our hands and give you praise for picture a hundred thousand people in unison and that feeling what that would do for our spirits our souls it s healing there s natural forms of healing about our environment um the friends that we re around what we re wearing what we re eating our diet so donde is a design company that um that uh i formed around 10 years ago and some of the people that worked at donda are now have went on to become heads of fashion houses like uh virgil s the head of louis vuitton and he was the head of donda at a certain point another guy that worked at donda is now the head of givenchy so this is like the the talent pool and this donda is basically my version of like a cyber you know extension of my brain like here s something that i m thinking of that you can t touch but we need to we need to bring it into fruition we need to manifest it and we have to see how to use things of our past and things of our now to create our future so it s a organization um created to guarantee the future of the human race really i thought about even calling it edna because i see us all as superheroes and aetna was the designer in the incredibles which is kind of almost really similar to donda i m just seeing these lineups and stuff so um so now our focus is food clothing shelter communication education and
