and then i remember talking to james terrell and i was like at the top of my lungs like screaming about saving uh saving ourselves and humanity and the reason why me and james needed to uh connect and then i went to uh my show and then it s like my like this like my head popped back and the spirit jumped out and it felt like it was like my mom talking and the last thing i said was this thing is over and i m saying it like i sound like my mom like donda like that s something she would have said if she was in the physical form when she sees her son you know exhausted like i just went through uh uh i had this uh fashion show we had this fashion show where we took over msg and just broke all boundaries sold 20 000 16 000 seats and played the new album and uh it was you know a thousand black people in the show and yeah like all young thug plugging in the iphone and uh travis and cuddy dancing he had 50 cent there jay z there lamar odom the uh the first time that people you know saw him and walk again uh was we walked together into the into the stadium uh and he s camo yeezy jacket all head to toe and the reason why that was so important is like when he was in a coma i would come by and play him the new music and once he was out of the coma he said that he remembered that music when he was in a coma and that was the album i was playing that day so that s the reason why me and lamar uh walked in together and then the next a few months later i did a fashion show and it started 45 minutes late and the media they just killed me they lebrond me as i would say like when lebron went to uh to um uh miami and they said you know who are you to have a a choice you know like what uh one of my other heroes tom brady he he left i didn t see no jerseys getting burned like when lebron uh left so then less than a week after that my wife is robbed in paris and so we we just because i m i m in the middle of a tour while i m doing the fashion show while i m doing this so we cancel the tour because it s it s very you know traumatic and then you know we start the tour back up and we get back into it and then i i just keep on saying i want to go to japan i just want to go to japan because japan is like a way that people treat there isn t like the systemic racism embedded in every single individual that s inside of the place like in america uh black white anything there s a systemic uh white white supremacy like when i tag you know white supremacy or we say this it s like the um yes that is america that is the world currently we ve been taught that my first superhero was superman you know and my dad was a black panther but you know when disney makes black panther now when you look it up you don t see my dad protecting his neighborhood or snatching a mic out of somebody s hand while they re lying i don t know you know like father like son right there uh but you see this character that s made for black people to idolize that was designed by a white white person and put out by a white company so it s controlling the narrative to say we re going to show you harriet tubman we re not going to show you not turner and they do it every chance they get maleficent uh um they called her her race of people the moors and the moors are and i just saw it again i was just like yo if you erase our history like most black people we don t know or we come we think we came from slaves we don t know our bloodline and we re we re given black history month and we take that like it s some gift to us no it s a programming to us racism doesn t end until we get to a point where we stop having to put the word black in front of it because it s like we re we re putting the rim a little bit lower for ourselves like it s when i say i m the second wealthiest black man in america like why do i have to say that because you know obviously if we just go on wealth period of what we call wealth like financial wealth that score card you know i d be like i m the i m the 78th wealthiest man in america but we shouldn t have to have a special box a special month because also what they show in black black history month is us getting hosed down reminding us that we were slaves like what if we had remember when i cheated on you month like remember when you first found the found the text messages remember how does that make you feel it makes you feel depleted and defeated you know it s no matter what religion you are what we can agree on is it is always
