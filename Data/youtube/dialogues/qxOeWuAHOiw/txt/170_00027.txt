america should be the dream you said all this all the things that you ve said in the most non politician way i ve ever heard anybody describe these things i know you really mean these things this is this is it s resonating with me that you re being a hundred percent honest and natural and that s that s what we re missing in politics today i mean it s one of the things that made people excited about trump as at least he was an alternative to the political talk he was an alternative to politicians speak where you know they re being dishonest and disingenuous but you just accept it you know they re reading things that have been written by speech writers but you just accept it because it says the things that you want to hear checks the boxes that ll say okay you got my vote what you re saying though is what you really feel and you really think and you re not saying it like a politician and that s what s going to resonate and people going to be mad at me if you get pregnant you become president
